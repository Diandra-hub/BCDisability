Is Trump (or the GOP) promoting violence against disabled people? ,"He claims that South American countries are sending people from insane asylums and mental institutions to America, but this isn’t even the part that I’m worried about. His party wants to cut social security. This will kill so many disabled people.

I’ve never been so humiliated in my life ,"Hey friends, I hope you’re all doing well. 

I’m at the airport and I have never been so humiliated in my life. I am disabled, take a wheelchair, and wear medical devices that can’t be scanned without being destroyed. They had taken my wheelchair to check it, and then I continued to stand there in pain. I have a spinal cord injury. This man (TSA) then demands that I take my shoes off while standing. I said I needed to sit to do that, to which he responded “then why’d you get out of the wheelchair?!” He had such an attitude and was so harsh, that I sat on the floor and cried my back was in so much pain. I got out of the chair because they told me the chair needed to be checked! I had even checked with an another agent about my sneakers, and he said that the female attendant would check them after she manually checked me out, no problem. 

After awkwardly explaining to all the onlookers why I was sitting on the floor, a female attendant came to pat me down around 7 minutes later. She was very kind even though I sobbed my eyes out the whole time. But that first man humiliated me, and I can’t figure out what he had to gain from being so cruel and insensitive to someone disabled. What I can say for sure is that he has no business working with the public if that’s how he treats anyone who is vulnerable and in a protected class.

What is your actual disability vs. what you tell people when they ask? ,"I’ve seen a few posts in here about people worried that they summarize their disabilities to people who are asking, or are curious. I’m not talking about doctors… but everyday people.

I have rheumatoid arthritis as well as vestibular dysfunction/vestibular migraine. So I have very weak strength as well as constant vertigo, imbalance. I walk with mobility aids plus assistance from family/friends. I’m asked frequently if I hurt myself, and my summary is, “I have a neurological issue and it causes imbalance.” No one has ever asked anything beyond that because 99.99% of people know nothing about neurology. I’d gladly explain to someone who had understanding if they had follow up questions.

"""Maybe those kinds of people should die.""","The tweet by Anna Bower recounts a claim made by Fred Trump III, Donald Trump's nephew, regarding a conversation with the former president about people with complex care needs. According to Fred Trump III, Donald Trump suggested that due to their condition and the expenses involved, ""maybe those kinds of people should just die.""

This claim is corroborated by multiple sources:

1. **Time Magazine**: An excerpt from Fred Trump III's forthcoming book *All in the Family* details the conversation, where Donald Trump allegedly made the statement during a White House meeting in 2020 [3].
2. **Mother Jones**: This source also reports on the same conversation, highlighting the disturbing nature of Trump's comment about disabled individuals [2].
3. **The Independent**: This source reiterates the claim, noting that Fred Trump III recounted this conversation in his book, emphasizing the former president's focus on the expenses associated with caring for people with disabilities [4].
4. **The Guardian**: Adds further context, mentioning that Fred Trump III found the comments appalling and hurtful, reflecting on the broader implications of such a mindset [7].

These sources collectively support the accuracy of the tweet's content, confirming that Fred Trump III has publicly recounted this conversation and that it has been reported by multiple reputable outlets.

How to tell my disabled partner to slow down a bit? ,"My girlfriend has been disabled 5 years now after a horrible car accident. She also has EDS, a type of connective tissue disease. Her left side experiences a lot of pain. 

Her last surgery was late last year and she was just cleared to drive. She’s been going out a lot more and doing stuff she hasn’t been able to do - I’m so proud of her! She hasn’t felt like a “real” person or adult, so seeing how happy she is when she can finally do these things is lovely.

There’s one thing. Now that she’s had more good days, she gets seriously depressed when things aren’t perfect. The more good days she has, the worse her reaction to a bad day is. She will push herself very far, often in denial that she still needs to pace herself. 

I tell her that even people who aren’t disabled need to pace themselves, and that it’s okay if she needs to take a break. But I know that being disabled and laying in bed for the past 5 years makes a “break” seem horrible. I know she’s restless and mentally ready to do everything she wants, but her body is just not there quite yet. 

How can I support my girl? Is there anything I can do better to help her? Maybe something better to say to help her take care of herself and acknowledge certain limits?

My Physical Therapist questioned my disability and I guess I just want to vent about it.,"For context I do have an invisible disability where I have pain, clumsiness, and weakness when using my hands that affects all of my hobbies, my personal grooming, I had to relearn how to cook with copious adaptations, and on bad days it hurts to brush my teeth and hold a spoon.  Honestly that's what I should have said.   Anyways, during my first visit the PT asked me what I did for work, and I told him I hadn’t been able to work for a few years due to the condition I just had surgery for. He asked me what I did before, and I told him I did tech support for a small family business locally, and how much I liked it yada yada. He asked if I thought I would be getting back to that, now that I’d had both arms operated on, and I said “Oh, no no no. I think I’ll be able to work like, as a walmart greeter now, but, you know, not with my hands again.”

“Really, what does your surgeon think about that?” I ended up expressing gratitude for the surgery, but that unfortunately I had a second condition the surgery was not able to help. He asked if I could for sure know I would have the same experience on this arm as I did the surgery on the other arm, and I said it was too early to know for sure, but my symptoms had always been identical on both sides, and I was experiencing some suspicious pain similar to my last surgery. I then overshared about my disability computer tech in an attempt at ‘proving’ how disabled I was to him which felt . . . idk degrading.

I’ve never had someone question my disability before, certainly not to my face. I’m not mad at the PT, I think he just thought I was misguided or something. He sees all of my surgeons patients, and they usually get back to work, or are at least given that expectation, and if they have to change careers later on the PT certainly doesn’t see that part because they would be out of his care by the time that decision is made. It just sucked as an experience. Even within my medical community I don’t feel understood, or maybe I just haven’t found my community yet. I would love a community for sharing tips and tricks for navigating the world when your hands don’t work the way their supposed to. Crip tech is huge for me (I used to see it as ergonomic technology hence the username), and my medical community is mostly just focused on surgery.",1,1ebcb6f,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ebcb6f/my_physical_therapist_questioned_my_disability/,5,1721854380.0
"I want a mobility aid, but my doctor is against it. What should I do?","Hello!

I'm Sagi (21, afab NB) and I've been suffering with chronic fatigue and pain for many years now and I have just received my diagnosis:
- ME/CFS
- Fibromyalgia 
- Generalized articular hypermobility 
- Miofascial syndrome 

My doctor also mentioned we investigate throughout our appointments about the possibly of POTS and IBS (he referred me to a gastroenterologist)

That is a lot to process, but I'm very happy to finally know something after years of unexplained pain. My doctor already suggested treatments with sleeping + muscle relaxant, stronger painkillers for extra painful days, swimming (as a way of exercise that's low impact) and CBT, as well as writing for my other doctors to let them know what's going on and combine the treatment. He was amazing and very attentive, I've never had that good of a doctor.

For a year now, I've been thinking about getting mobility aids (preferably a cane and a rollator with seating) to help me lessen the fatigue and feel more stable in more painful days. I don't plan on using it every day, just when I feel like I need some extra support. However, my doctor said it's a bad idea, because I might increase the pain and tension in my wrist and shoulder, my partner seems very against the idea as well. They say I have to exercise to strengthen my body.

I understand their point, and that's specifically why I don't plan on using it everyday. But never? I'm scared. I wish I had some support, at least a cheap cane for now since the treatment is long term to start working, and maybe, even with treatment, for harder days. 

So, what do you think about it? Should I get a cane or am I overreacting and getting too ahead of myself?

Anybody here have Tarsal Tunnel? The wheelchair helps but I’m a bit afraid to see a doctor? Will they tell me I dont need it?,"I’ve had chronic pain for 11 years now. It began in 2013-2014. 
Having lived in rural Texas, treatment was not an option more than 2-3 times a year at most due to my uninsured and living in poverty status without access to resources.

I just got a job and it’s a lot of walking, my third day of work i was in so much agony i thought id have to give up this dream job until i found a wheelchair at the thrift store.

I’ve been using a wheelchair off and on for the past 5 years. And I would like to get a custom fitted one to have a as tool.

With this thrifted one, it’s a little too big for me and hurts my knees to use (but that hurts much less than walking for my full shift.) and despite the rare ache from foot propelling myself, I feel so much better???
I’m not in crippling pain every day anymore?
Even if i only use the wheelchair for only a portion of my shift. Without it, I am in agony.

I feel like my body is starting to heal, and i can still keep my job??

My new health insurance is about to kick in soon after my 90 days at my new job. I’m wanting to see a doctor if they’ll write a prescription for a custom chair for me.
But I’m also afraid that they’ll try to talk me out of it because i don’t have a “severe” condition.

I am getting an AFO hinged ankle brace 

(I have Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction, Chronic Plantars Fasciitis, Hypermobile joints, congenitally short Achilles tendons, Hallux Valgus, Tarsal Tunnel)

Most of these issues don’t usually put someone in a wheelchair, but I’m experiencing a lot of nerve pain and have been for the past 10-11 years. The chair is the only thing that helps prevent that pain.

I’m afraid of surgeries, and surgery wasn’t an option but might be with my upcoming health insurance?

Do you think they’ll rush me into surgery first rather than a custom wheelchair? 

Idk
I guess I’m just afraid and conflicted and confused and apprehensive??

I’m finally not in pain, my job lets me use this wheelchair and I’m able to walk more because i can sit and scoot and save my “Standing and Walking” spoons for tasks that require standing or walking. Rather than walking and standing all day AND doing all those tasks too.

And now because I’m not in constant pain I feel like “what if I don’t need the chair anymore?”

But then I know I’ll be in pain if I don’t have it?


Kind of like depression medication.
“I feel so good, i don’t need to take this anymore!” But the medication is what helps keep one’s mood elevated and then going without the meds you end up back to square one?

I’m fully ambulatory and have full range of movement. I can jump and run. But I can’t be up on my feet for more than a few hours. And on the one hand. I am in so much pain but on the other hand, am i just being a baby? Being lazy? 

I don’t think it’s FUN to haul a wheelchair around, I hate the stares I get. But the wheelchair gives me freedom to be out longer without suffering or paying for it later. I feel better when I’m able to use it, versus “powering through” without.

But I’m just conflicted i guess. I’m not sure what is internalized ableism, what is normal pain. Idk.

Does anyone else use a wheelchair due to similar issues? :(

Interabled lesbian couple wanting to adopt in  USA: Do we have a chance?,"Hi all.

I'm on SSI, she is not and works. We live in the east coast and we plan to adopt a child (Age 5+) in the future. 

For me, I'm wondering if there are barriers we might face as a lesbian interabled couple that we can prepare for now, ahead of time.
 I know the biggest would probably be not being able to be married or posing as married, as well as living on gf's salary and my SSI. Another might be the unpredictable nature of my hydrocephalus.

Psych exam ,"
 Hello do I have a mental exam in less than an hour for disability. I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2009 Borderline Personality Disorder in 2023 and Major depressive disorder in 2023. I’ve been in the hospital three times for psychiatric reasons. I’ve been taking all kinds of different medications and non have worked. I’m currently in the process of switching doctors because I need someone who’s going to listen to me. I quit my last job because my anxiety has made it so hard for me to even walk out the door I think I have agoraphobia! I haven’t been fully diagnosed with anxiety as I know of but I have been given medications and things for it so I don’t know.. I go to counseling too! I’m a nervous wreck!! Do they look at my medications? I’ll be honest most days I could care less about myself and either forget to take my medications or just say fuck it but I have been recently! Should I shower and dress nice so they know I’m taking this seriously or show them that I literally can’t get out of bed most days? What are the questions and how do I answer them? What shouldn’t I say or do? I’m very intelligent tbh I’m afraid I’ll be too smart for them to say I’m able to not work!! The exam is over zoom and I’m having a panic attack. please somebody help me pass these tests so that I can take care of my daughter and myself. My dad passed last year and I would literally be homeless if it wasn’t for my cousin. I need advice if anyone could help thank you!

I got fired for my disability and I need help finding a lawyer. ,"So I have really bad agoraphobia. I was looking so hard to find a job that lets me work remotely because of my extreme fear of leaving my house and traveling alone outside of my comfort zone or being outside at night. I finally had a job which I thought was perfect for myself and what I know how to do is working in the healthcare field, but I get to do a remotely after my 60 days of training.

This organization is supposed to help people with disabilities. They monitor people with various disabilities and their homes. when I signed up for the job, I didn’t understand that there would be so much reading comprehension skills, and I have a learning disability that struggles with reading comprehension skills. I had a harder time reading the protocols and also getting misdirection from my supervisor. So they called me in the office one time to tell me that I was having a hard time understanding the protocols and things that they expected from me and I thought I understood everything. 

I decided from that point to try to use a reader from the accessibility tools off the computer. Well, about a week or two later, they call me into fire me over this, and I explained to them that I had to learn disability. I gave them paperwork explaining my disability different accommodations I had received in college for my learning disability. Yet they still decided to fire me. Now I’m trying to find a lawyer and I’ve been spending hours all day trying to contact different people. I just want justice. I feel that this is so unfair, especially for an organization that’s supposed to be helping people with disabilities refuses to have inclusivity in the workplace.

My slight disability is ruining my life,"DISCLAIMER: My disability is not a big deal and might be nowhere as bad for some people here. It may seem funny for some of you that it is such a big deal to me.

Here is some introduction. I’m 20 years old and my friend group have found girlfriends in the past 6 months and because of that we don’t hang out in summer that much. Like once a week.
I feel very alone and depressed because of lack of things to do. Like literally NOTHING besides playing games - which makes me even more depressed, because it makes me feel like I’m wasting my time/life. I feel very useless right now.

I’d like to do something with my life - go to gym, get a job, and most importantly - find a girlfriend to have someone to do things with etc.


The thing is I have slight disability: I have been born with my fingers cut in half in one of my hands for some reason and… literally everything that you can think of requires two hands. I feel very insecure about it and I always avoid using that hand when other people have a chance of noticing my disability. I don’t want to go to gym because other people will look on it and I’d feel uncomfortable, I avoided getting a job because in every job you have to use your hands. I always avoided new friends, because I’m scared of starting everything from start: people start noticing my hand, then they look on it literally every time they can. This shit makes me very uncomfortable. This is the reason I have never talked to many girls and potentially new friends. Also going to IT school didn’t help (90% of school was male). 

I know that people don’t care about it as much as I think. I know they barely care. I know I can’t live like that, but somehow I still hope deep inside me that I will go through life without putting myself in uncomfortable situations. I think about literally 99% of the time when I’m with people. Even when I just walk in front of friend group, I think that someone could stare at it from behind. 

I failed one of the best uni’s in my country because I didn’t want to go on Labs where we had to do things with our hands.

I feel like I’m wasting life. This uni thing really destroyed my ego and I feel like a failure. I had this problem for my whole life but I just realized how big it is, when it’s time to grow up, find a job, find a girlfriend.

My dad has mechanical business which I would like to continue. Paradoxically I’m good at mechanical things. In my free time I could go with him on jobs to learn something. The thing is he doesn’t work alone and I’m scared for shit to do things with my hands when other people are watching.

When I was younger whenever I had argument with other friends, they would always say something about my hand. I also had a group of friends which I was very very close, that were also a school bullies. I had argument with one of them and he put other friends against me. They sent me a pics their normal hands on one picture etc. and also said many things about my hand. 

Maybe it’s the source of my problem? I don’t think so but it could’ve taken a big part in it. I always hid my hand from other way before this situation.

I always thought that finding a soulmate gf would help me. But it’s really hard when I didn’t even start trying to have one.

I thought about psychological help but at the same time I think I don’t want to accept my hand. I don’t want to be publicly known as a person with this disability

If you read it this far - thank you. I’m looking forward for helpful tips

If this post also fit topic of other subs (disability) please let me know about it so I can post it there.

Why is addiction risk only an issue now??,I’m 20 and have spinal stenosis. My mom had it diagnosed in her twenties too and got surgery last year. My memaw is in a wheelchair for it because she has degenerative disc disease. My genetics are telling me to get ahead of this now. The pain is pretty bad to the point when I stand up it usually takes a solid 30 secs to fully be able to stand/walk normally despite my narrowing only being “mild”. I am working on losing weight but that obviously isn’t gonna happen overnight especially when I can’t work out very much without being unable to stand/sit and needing to lay down to relieve the pain. My back feels like it’s just gonna snap in half and I’m so so stiff. I have tried muscle relaxers and pain meds but the only thing that works is biofreeze and some Tylenol 3 my mom gave me. I slept normally for the first time in months. I asked my doc if she could prescribe it to me since it made such a massive difference. She said no because it’s highly addictive. I have been off and on highly addictive and dangerous psych meds since I was 8. I never needed them. I wasn’t depressed. I had undiagnosed hypothyroidism that caused such severe “depression” (thyroid fatigue) that I couldn’t get out of bed and had to drop out of high school. My new doc is great for the most part but why do they have an issue with potentially addictive now when I am physically in pain all day and night and have a hard time working but when I was 15 they had no issue having me on 3 highly addictive meds?

Depressing small talk with drs ,"What am I supposed to say to drs when they do the whole bedside manner talk? They always ask questions about what I like to do and I can’t help but say something depressing and I can tell it rubs them the wrong way.

Advice,"I was hired at a job that was mostly remote - 1 day a week in the office which then turned to 2 days a week in May.  Then the mayor issues a return to office request for all city employees and contract workers (myself).  I submitted ADA accommodation paperwork from my treating psychiatrist because I have Bipolar Disorder.  The request was to maintain my two days a week in the office with no consecutive days.  I just found out it was denied.  I'm not a city employee and I learned that most city employees have been getting all remote work accommodation requests approved..  This is a clear violation of ADA rights.  They advised me that I can take off work so I don't work consecutive days in the office but that's a punishment to me (it eats into my paycheck) and a disservice to my department because it significantly eliminates time to accomplish my work duties.

"""Holistic medicine"" and people's fear of pills","Hey guys, I hope this is the right place for this. I've recently been diagnosed with Behcets, gastritis, and looking into a sleep disorder like narcolepsy. I've just started my first round of immunosuppressants. The amount of medicine I take in a day is about 13 pills. As the treatment continues things will change. I keep having people tell me it's a shame my doctors aren't doing a more holistic approach and that I should try to get off medicine as soon as possible. I'm pretty skeptical of like over the counter vitamins and diets not prescribed by my doctors. My doctors haven't given me any life style changes other than acupuncture as a suggestion. I guess I'm a little confused and skeptical about people's suggestions of cutting out bread, or cupping or essential oils. I'd give it ago if I knew there was data to back it up is there a good way to know what is snake oil and what can be helpful? Can a diet really make a big change or is it more of a plasibo? It also seems like alot of the advice I get is because people are afraid I'll be on medicine for the rest of my life. Is it bad to be on medicine for ever? Everyone (not my doctors) is like if you can not be dependent on medicine you shouldn't be. Is there something backing this up or is it just stigma?

Does anyone else experience this?,"I have lost my voice YET AGAIN. Problem is that I am training for my new job and I need to be able to talk to participate in class. 

This has been an ongoing problem for years. I used to be able to sing like a songbird and now I sound like a crow. An otolaryngologist looked at my vocal cords in 2020 and they were red with a few polyps on them. I honestly wondered if it was because of my asthma issues that caused this since my asthma attacks consist of terrible coughing. 

Moreover if I am around asthma triggers (pollen, dust, harsh chemicals and smoke) I lose my voice until I get away from it. Sometimes it lasts if I was around whatever caused it for a long time. Pollen has been bad here for a bit and someone was smoking outside the store when my boyfriend and I were leaving it. :(

I have two asthma variants on my medical chart: cough variant asthma and eosinophilic asthma. I am on so many medications. Two maintenance inhalers (Wixela and Spireva), two nasal sprays (Fluoctozine and Azelstine), two antihistimes (Monteklaust and Hydrozine but I take that one for anxiety) plus a Dupixent injection every two weeks. Yeah, it is a lot but they seem to help and I cant get off the maintenance inhalers or insurance will take away my Dupixent. I've tried looking for answers so I can bring it back up to a doctor but I am drawing blanks. I've heard of allergic laryngitis but I am not sure about it?

Do any of you experience this? Any suggestions for what I should look up? It was great for a while but now it's been like this for two days. 

Also if you experience this do you have any tips for dealing with it and/or accomodations you have for it? A bit nervous that if my employers find out that I could be let go and I really like this job so far. Plus I need it since I will be moving in with my boyfriend soon.

Accessibility at State Parks (advice or creative adaptation ideas),"Sort of a weird situation, my family has rented a cabin at a state park, only to find out the roads and paths are ALL gravel. This means I have to either walk or roll over gravel everytime I need to use the restroom. I use a wheelchair most the time I leave the house, I will also have forearm crutches. I have damaged a ligament in my ankle and have had tendon issues since I was a kid, so walking on hills and gravel are not a strong skill of mine. We are trying to come up with every possible solution we can so I can still go, does anyone have any recommendations? I will be calling the park tomorrow and asking if any of our solutions would work so I'm just trying to gather any and all ideas! My independence is really important to me, especially since I won't be able to join most of the hikes, I don't want family to have to stay back to help me go to and from the restroom. This trip is really meaningful to me, I grew up going here so I really don't want to miss out!

- golf cart rental (no clue if they have any or the $)
- seeing if they have any cabins with a toilet
- plywood ""bridge"" (would have to ask if it can be left there...idk if that would work with cars going over it)

.

Stepping round her body twirls

She spins and springs and loftward lifts

To everyone the air looks still

A dancer safe In her domain 

.

Belying even to the girl

How easy she should ply her gifts

So when she tires she must be ill

Her weakness reason for her pain

.

But surreptitious whispered swirls

Reveal the lie of vista's grift

The warm illusion falls to chill

and bite of cataclysmic rain

.

The gale force threatening to hurl

The dancer’s form against the cliffs

But this risk just reveals her will

To keep her feet against the strain

.

Beneath the storm her moves unfurl

Through sheets of hail perspective shifts

She leaps like lightning with the thrill

Of dancing in a hurricane

Wage substitution ,"Hi,
I apologize if the question is naive, I’m still navigating through this process

Is it reasonable to ask my employer to supplement the remainder 40%? My employer supplements the gap in wage for pregnancy and family leave, but not a medical leave.


Thanks in advance

Oregon DHS vs SS disability ,"I thought when I was told by an autism specialist at my sons iep meeting that he qualifies for disability and could get $640 a month plus extra services, i filled out her paperwork. He was 16 then. I got a letter from DHS that said he is disabled. This was after paperwork and a virtual doctors visit. I looked online & read how it takes 6 months to get payments. He was deemed disabled 1/29/2023. So today I called ss.gov only to find out there is nothing on him. That I have to apply separately and it takes 2 years. I broke down & started crying, which he saw & led to a meltdown. I'm just out of the hospital with my own health issues and don't feel good. She helped me get him started but I think I gave the last digit of my phone # wrong(dealing w/aki and liver injury, so my brains not working). And they're suppose call to set me up with an intake appointment. I called back, but their day ended until tomorrow.
My son has had iep with extensive accommodations since his diagnosis at age 7. I needed help with him way before that and still do. Not once until he was 16 did anyone suggest I apply for disability for him. And no one told me this was for a case worker and respite care if I need a break. Nobody said, btw apply for ssdi too. Now he's 17 and I was expecting it to be all falling into place. Now it's going to be another 2+ years because nobody knows how to say hey, here are all the things that could help you.
As someone who has never utilized special services, how am I supposed to know all this?
He can tell I'm upset, so now he's crying. With my health problems and no help from his dad, I'm at my wits end. I'm so frustrated. Why can't 1 person help you navigate everything. I need a respite break from him, fortunately he has a place to go for 2 nights.
Why does everything have to be so hard?
I'm gonna go cry myself to sleep. I have to drink fluids but I can't eat. I'm at my breaking point. My own health issues(besides the cancer) are basically disagreements between specialist. If it wasn't for my kids, I would check out. My mom had money saved to go to a little vacation, a loop from N. CA to back home in OR with maybe a stop at the Mayo clinic. My youngest wants to see the grand canyon so bad. You know what he told me when I told him the savings were not enough, he said ""that's ok mom, I love you."" He's 12.

Anyone on private disability (STD/LTD)? Which doctors are the most supportive?,"I've been off disability for two years now and my current job is trying to be accommodating. Unfortunately my neurologist decided abruptly to end treatment and I am scrambling to protect my job while he comes to his senses.

I haven't asked him about disability yet. I did ask him to give me more time to prepare, and he grudgingly obliged, but at most that gives me six months before I become disabled again. I am scrambling to get my affairs in order while I still can.

Currently I have a neurologist and a psychiatrist, and will be seeing at least one psychologist. I'm working to get a primary care doctor but that may take a while. My neurologist may agree to do disability paperwork, but I'm a bit concerned about trusting him due to how quickly he decided to end treatment. I would guess that my psychiatrist would support my claim if I explain what my neurologist did, but given how well I've been doing these last few years it may be hard to explain why I'm suddenly unable to work.

When I first became physically disabled six years ago, getting doctors to do paperwork was like pulling teeth sometimes. I really love my job and I don't want to lose it.

I have a rollator/transport wheelchair in my Amazon cart. Should I go ahead and buy it to take on vacation?,"We are traveling to Florida for a family vacation. I (54F) have mild CFS. I can get around, still have a great deal of physical strength, but my constitution sux, as well as having that never ending fear of triggering a flare. I recently had to travel on short notice, deal with a stressful situation and lug 50 lbs around multiple airports, and did so without flaring, so my reticence about purchasing any sort of assistive device is redoubled. 

However, our upcoming trip will be an active one, much more active than my last travel experience. The zoo, botanical gardens, water parks (for the kids) among other things. My youngest thinks the idea of a wheelchair is neat, and has offered to be the one to push me around. My husband, on the other hand, might be resistant to the idea of having a wheelchair at all. because he doesn’t want to attract attention. He’s very fixated on being “normal.” 

Also, I don’t know if it will survive being gate checked. Maybe I should have it shipped directly to the hotel?

Career change advice,"Hi everyone!

I have been given a decision to make a career change that might be more ideal for my condition. For context, I have a degree in marine biology but shortly after college my condition started to develop. I have Becker’s muscular dystrophy. It has made me extremely weak so basic things like squatting, doing upstairs, standing for more than 20 minutes, or getting up from a seated position are difficult for me. On top of that, I have chronic pain in a lot of places in my body. 

This has kind of taken a toll on my career plans since many marine biology jobs are physically demanding and can require lots of travel. I live about an hour away from the ocean and my original plan was to find work out on the coast after graduation. I don’t think I would be able to handle a commute even I were able to get a marine biology job and moving out doesn’t seem like a good idea either since I need help with lots of things. I have been seeking aid from the department of rehabilitation and vocational services and a career that would work best with my condition and knowledge would be office administration. I don’t have any clerical experience but they suggested I find programs at a local community college that could certify me for the skills required for a job in an office setting. I’ll admit, I am not great with computers but I know the basics and I know I can learn more about them.

I never pictured myself doing this type of work but I also never imagined I would have developed a disability either. I have been out of work for quite some time so I think really any position will be beneficial to develop my work ethic and knowledge.
I do believe an office job can open up a lot of doors in the future and hopefully is able to land me a job related to marine biology. I just hope I am not making the wrong decision about this and wasting my degree. 

I guess what I really want to know is if anyone here had a plan for their career but needed to make a change due to their disability. Was it difficult but necessary? And was it something that worked out for you in the end? Thanks for reading!

AITA for using the handicap bathroom stalls?,"So I've asked a few disabled individuals before but I wanna get more of a widened scope of opinions.

  
I (22f) am diabetic and have been since I was 10. Insulin is a necessity for me and the form I use is the pens (literally look like pens with the caps and everything. I use two types so when I go out to eat, I typically need to go to the bathroom to administer insulin. With the pen formatting, I need room to set down 2 pens, their respective caps, 2 screw-on needles, any backup needles in a baggie, and my purse/backpack. The standard stalls are usually *very* narrow with no surfaces to place anything, save for maybe a tiny trash can that can barely fit a single pen. With the handicap stalls, however, there is usually some form of surface that isn't the floor that I can set my stuff down on. Worst case scenario there are no surfaces, I at least have enough room on the floor to maneuver. 

I try to make sure my insulin pens are visible in my hands going in and out of the stall, but I still feel guilty. I've only received a dirty look from an older women in a wheelchair exiting the stall, but I worry that something more extreme and confrontational may happen in the future. I just want to know if I'm being ableist or just a straight-up asshole by doing this, or if I'm justified in using these stalls.

Some other info that's probably important: I am able to walk without any mobility aid. The only mobility aids I use are wrist splints for my carpal tunnel, and they're only used at home. On the outside, I do not look disabled and can easily use the standard stalls if only needing to use the toilet. If I am not taking insulin, I go into the standard stalls.

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for your kindness and support 🫶

In reference to the concern about the sanitation aspect, I grew up thinking that was normal. My parents are of an older generation so at first they had some… traditional opinions, but they’ve come to realize it’s better to have a living daughter who gets the occasional dirty look than to have an ill or dead daughter. I’m trying to do my injections more at the booth than in the restroom, but there are occasions where that unfortunately isn’t an option.

What’s your experience living with a hidden disability?,"(19F) I have an invisible disability, broke my back about a year ago. It affects me in multiple ways every day. 

During the first 6 months of my injury I used crutches. I stopped because of the amount of absolutely horrible backlash I faced from family and the looks from strangers as I ‘seemed fine’.

I’ve gotten looks and been denied use of the disabled bathroom until I HAVE TO explain my disability to the authority member. Always told I’m faking it and people, even STRANGERS angrily trying to convince me I’m not disabled and I’m shaming the disability community, the list seriously goes on.

"Complex situation, feeling lost. tw abuse","I've been married for 24+ years to a horribly abusive man. He didn't start out that way. What a disaster! He knew I was disabled way back then. I have hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and all of the gifts that come with it. As my age progressed, so did my condition until I was in a wheelchair after leaving the stroke unit. He would refuse to bring my chair at first. ""I can't handle this. It's too much."" Then, I was forced to 'knee crawl' when my joints got worse because he was nicer to me if I used my chair less. I can practically hear some of you cringe in advance. Like I said, he's abusive. But it gets much worse. 

He got more and more physically abusive with time. He'd started threatening to end my life. I believed him. I told my cousin, ""If anything happens to me, he did it."" She commented about how she thought it was getting better. So I whispered sharply, ""IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, HE DID IT.. OK?"" ""Ok."" Less than a month later, it happened. 

He was driving while enraged, abusing me while he drove. We were getting close to our driveway, and I couldn't wait to go inside and get some rest. Being abused is exhausting. When we reached the driveway, someone was blocking it, facing outward, waiting for their kid to get back from school. He was even more angry. He looked at the car, ahead at the oncoming traffic, and then at me. That was when he turned sharply into traffic, and I was crushed by an oncoming truck hauling an excavator. 

After I woke up from an 11 day coma, he tried to leave the hospital immediately. That should've raised flags for the staff. If he were concerned, he would've wanted to see me and talk to me. But, I think he was afraid of when I could talk to personnel about what happened. He was pouring it on thick, saying he couldn't live without me, and he was going to make sure I was well taken care of. 

Fast forward 4 months until I was finally released. He immediately began hurting me again, even strangling me and saying the truck should've crushed me the rest of the way.. oh, so much more.. 😭 You get the idea. I was calling for help so much that it felt like a cruel joke.  He'd always meet the cops outside and chat them up since I couldn't go outside without help. I was told everything from his death threats were freedom of speech to I used excessive force to get him to stop pinning me to the wall by my face and throat when I'd asked twice for him to let go and I socked him one to finally stop him holding me back by my neck.

One day, he left in a cruel way if there were a need for anything more. He ran a smear campaign before ditching, telling friends that I was cheating(wasn't) and that I was the bad guy. He moved in with my young female cousin, the daughter of the one I turned to when I felt endangered.>HUGE RED FLAG!< He took most of my belongings and put them in a storage unit I had no access to when I was not home yet. So, when he left, he destroyed my support network and stole as much as he could get his hands on. Now, my adult children are by my side. They sadly know the truth from within the nightmare. Everyone else disappeared with my abuser.

Now, I'm starting over with a large chunk surgically removed from my right hip and upper leg and right hand nerve damage that has taken away my artistic abilities. I used to paint, draw, sew, dance, sing.. Oh yeah, I have stridor from being strangled while I was healing. All of those talents are useless now. I can't do any of them anymore. Omg my education was art oriented with a minor in psychology. I was aiming to be an art therapist. I was almost there. The dream is over. Dammit 😭😭

Sorry for the long post. I feel horribly alone. I know my kids are the best people. They're awesome. But my heart is broken, and it won't stop breaking. 

tldr: Abuser destroyed my career and social life and almost killed me. I survived. Now what?

Can't Afford Me,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years. He said he wouldn't marry me because I'm a single mother of 4 and on government benefits like foodstamps. I give him $400 a month to help out with bills. Our food is seperate due to not losing my benefits so Basically what he is saying  is that he can't afford me. Oh he can sleep with me though and get pleasure but won't put a ring on me. So what it boils down to is I'm sleeping with the landlord. He whines because I'm not showing him enough affection or lay with him enough. Yeah, hurts doesn't it. Am I wrong? Yeah, I know it would be cheaper if we didn't get married but when your so inlove (which I'm not any longer), you wouldn't care. He has enough money for rent, utilities, food and such but just doesn't want to take that extra step into marriage. WE broke up after 5 years because I was done. Not getting any younger so I moved out. So get this, he talks to his long time friend in France and they decide to get serious and for her to move in with him. We'll they would have to get married in order for her to do so and what was he going to do??? Yes, marry her but she changed her mind because she thought really hard about her family. Well, after 2 to 3 years go by, I was loosing my apartment and had nowhere to go. We decided to give our relationship another try. That's when I found out he wouldn't marry me because I was on food stamps but he was going to marry the woman in France? Yes I am still here but I have no intentions of marrying him now. Not because of the assistance, it's because the kids and I opinions doesn't matter. He's always right, and if he doesn't know and I do, he looks it up first before believing me. Just little stuff like that. I need another opinion on this to see if you see this situation the same as I do. He wants my pleasure and when he doesn't get it, he pouts.

Creating a support group,"So I live in a small (14 grand) town. Plenty of resources for specific disorders. Alcoholics Anonymous, grief support. I've lived here 7 years and resources only come by word of mouth. 

 I can't help but feel impacted by the support I've received from this sub. The support that I see within every post. I realized how necessary it's been while I've been going through this new stage of my life.

I decided that instead of waiting and wishing for something to pop up, I can be the one who creates it. I've spent 7 years in various group therapy, I have experience running a skills group. But really, it's just about showing up. 

I want to run this group in an ""anonymous"" type way. Confidentiality, what's said in the room stays in the room. It's a small town so who knows what information will be spread. I want to create a set of guidelines so if people come and go, there's some continuity. General respect when others are speaking. 

My goal is to gather people struggling with disabilities and provide support in a group setting. I've been told they have mental health support groups but I'm looking for a broader reach. 

I've got a list of 10 people so far that want this to happen. So I won't stop now. I just want to make sure I'm inclusive to a broad community.

I've thought about members bringing lists of topics they'd like to discuss. I have no problem organizing any pass outs or worksheets. I'm disabled, all I have is time. Also I'm not trying to do a coping group. That's always a good topic, but eating 1 more fruit a day isn't what I want to hear. It's so often that people running the groups have no idea how tired we are of hearing ""advice"". 

Is there anything else that I'm missing? What would you want out of a support group? What topics would you enjoy talking about with a group? 

I'm going to bring fidgets, games, coloring books. All things that can make it easier to talk to people.

Please tell me anything you think I should know. I want this group to be community directed not just my own structure and guidelines. I want the members to be able to participate in a way that they feel supported.

Advice on self-advocacy at the doctor,"I had my yearly physical today and tried to bring up some knee pain and clicking in my knees I've been experiencing. I have gait and balance problems due to FND which I'm pretty sure is causing the pain. My doctor brushed me off saying, ""Knees click."" Well mine didn't before this.

I then explained I was worried about damage to my cartilage and she was like, ""Well if it's the cartilage there's nothing we can do anyway."" We were at the end of our time so she reluctantly ordered an x-ray (idk if that's even the right test for this) and then abruptly left. I'm not sure if the door just naturally closes hard but it felt like she slammed it as well.

Wtf do I do now? I'm inexperienced at navigating doctor BS. It feels like she is just expecting me to accept living with chronic pain because I'm disabled. I guess I'm going to try to get a second opinion but I am TIRED.

Invisible disability; got to experience visible disability,"I have a chronic illness that used to have me out of commission about 10% of the time. I've been able to manage it a lot better since 2020 (isolation and masks are incredible.) But nobody respects my boundaries (not even family) and even when people know the details it doesn't seem to register. I have no illusions about how disabilities get treated by the general public.

Six weeks ago, I tore my ACL. I've been walking with a knee brace, but generally haven't required any other aids. However, I had two trips scheduled to take my 7yo to see grandparents, so I had to fly 3 weeks ago (1 hr flight) and last week (two 2.5 hour flights with a long layover.) I have to use a cane in the airport because it's very difficult for me to walk up and down ramps and the jetway. So I am currently quite visibly disabled while traveling.

Airline personnel \*should be\* used to working with passengers with disabilities but I was shocked at how little understanding they actually have of my needs. There's probably something about a guy in his 40s with a cane that throws them off.

Anyways, I was asked to do a lot of awkward things (like carry my bags through awkward tight spaces to bag drop with people squeezing through while I was struggling. Had to ditch the brace and cane at security and got no assistance most of the time to walk without falling. Pulled one of my bags for extra screening and wouldn't return my brace and cane which were not being screened. Gate agents challenging the validity of my disability even though per airline rules you need only assert a disability and you can't be challenged on it. Flight attendants wanting me to use the bathroom that was farthest from me, and stand around waiting for it.)

None of this is exactly a revelation to me, but it was the first time I directly experienced this particular type of indifference.",28,1e9l5os,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1e9l5os/invisible_disability_got_to_experience_visible/,4,1721672037.0

"Driving, Driving School for Wheel Chair User. ","Hello everyone,

I am reaching out on behalf of my girlfriend, who is seeking assistance with learning to drive and finding employment. She recently contacted the Department of Rehabilitation in Los Angeles County and spoke with a representative regarding these matters. Prior to this, she attended the Abilities Expo where she learned about the Department of Rehabilitation through a panel discussion on driving for disabled individuals.

During the expo, the representatives from the Department of Rehabilitation presented their program in a way that led her to believe they could help her get behind the wheel. However, when she spoke with them today, she was informed that they only assist disabled individuals who need to drive for job-related purposes. They cited the availability of public transportation, Access, Uber, and Lyft as reasons for this limitation. The representative's supervisor confirmed this policy, leaving her without the support she was hoping for.

We are now seeking advice and assistance from anyone who has successfully navigated this process and obtained a vehicle and driver's license despite these challenges. Any information, phone numbers, or resources you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,

Any advice on how to function better?,"Hi everyone, 

This is probably a lot but I need help.
I acquired a physical problem after I ripped my tendon doing a mountain marathon. My left quad muscle completely wasted away and I couldn't walk for 3 years. In that time I had to quit my job and  luckily got a new teaching job in further education I could do in my wheelchair but behind it all I was really struggling as I didn't get any help and mostly found it more stressful dealing with the medical profession during that time and spent a lot of money on doctors who didn't help. I bought my own wheelchair off a girl I know. Around that time I also had a hernia operation and had a severe reaction after which led to panic attacks as I thought I was going to die. I was in a verbally abusive relationship at that time but got out when I was too scared of him and he threatened me and thought he was going to strangle me. 
 I don't know what happened really in my body but I feel like I can't function the way I used to. I'm really hyperreactive emotionally and if I hear raised voices I get panic attacks etc. I'm due to go back to work in a few weeks and worried I'm going to lose my job as I don't seem to be able to cope with any stressors without having a crazy over the top emotional physical reaction. What can I do to get better? 
I tried some antidepressants but they make me feel terrible and talk therapy but it's not helping at all. I also get flashbacks of the ex screaming at me and get the old feelings coming up in my body. How can I recover? Sometimes I think I'm better but will hear a loud bang and all the old emotions and feelings come back and my brain swells up and I can't think properly for a week or more. I really can't lose my job over this. Can anyone help with ideas on what I can do?
I'm on prozac 20mg at the moment but honestly it's doing nothing. ",1,1ea2hul,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ea2hul/any_advice_on_how_to_function_better/,2,1721722714.0
Supporting my ESA as a graduate student,"Hi! I was admitted into a Master's program a couple of months ago, and have received accommodations for my ESA to live with me in on-campus housing due to my psychiatric diagnoses and symptomology.

As a Master's student, I will be researching and writing a thesis, limiting the amount of time I can work part-time outside of my federal work-study. With this, I was wondering if anyone had any experience using federal student loans to cover costs for their ESA, or if anyone had any other insight regarding this matter? 

Since I received accommodations from disability resources at my university and have the proper, required medical documentation to support my ESA, I believe that my ESA's regular expenses would qualify as disability-related expenses, therefore making it permissible for me to use federal student loan funds to cover them. However, I am unsure. Also, for clarification, the funds would be used to pay *only* for the following: annual vet visits, prescriptions (currently only for flea and tick prevention), food, waste management supplies, and potential emergency vet visits that are required for the health and wellbeing of my ESA.",0,1ea1swc,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ea1swc/supporting_my_esa_as_a_graduate_student/,0,1721719931.0
My doctor made me cry,"
Hey everyone,

A couple of days ago, I went to the dermatologist to check a rash that was spreading, causing redness, itchiness, and inflammation. I found out I have eczema. Besides that, I have flat, overpronated feet, making them look crooked, especially in shoes. I already hate my feet so much because they cause me a lot of pain—in my ankles, feet, knees, and back. They’re my biggest insecurity, and it really hurts when people stare and make comments because they don’t understand why my feet look the way they do. I’ve tried everything—special shoes, inserts, insoles—but my feet just are the way they are. My parents never got me the corrective help I needed when I was younger, and now as an adult, it’s led to a lot of pain, physical discomfort, and lack of confidence. I’ve learned to ignore people and their comments, developing tough skin over the years, but this experience was different.

During the appointment, the nurse kept glancing at my feet, which I ignored. When the doctor came in, he did the same while explaining my skin condition. After the appointment, as he was leaving, he loudly and sarcastically said, “Oh, by the way, I love your shoes,” drawing everyone’s attention to my feet. There were at least 10 staff members around as we were leaving the room, and he said it while facing them. Everyone immediately looked at my feet, making me feel humiliated. The nurse laughed, making me feel even more hurt.

I cried for a good 20 minutes after my appointment. I’ve learned over the years to ignore people and their comments about my feet, but this felt super deliberate and planned. He waited until after the appointment to say it, as if to really drive the point home. I didn’t expect a professional, like a doctor, to make fun of me in that way. This is one of the most hurtful comments I’ve gotten recently about my feet, and I don’t think I want to go back there.

I just wanted to vent and share this, not for sympathy but just because it was super hurtful and upsetting.",212,1e935qw,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1e935qw/my_doctor_made_me_cry/,80,1721614732.0
Will my disability affect my job offer? ,"Hello everyone! I am a 27F and I was born with a non-seeing/blind left eye.

Personal Assistant/ Public toilets,"Evening all, 

I'm a PA for a 22 year old female (I am a 25 year old male). She has mental and physical disabilities including epilepsy. What would the etiquette be to using public toilets while out in public? 
Disabled toilets are usually available but I try to avoid them for others with less mobility/more severe disabilities.
Generally the mens cubicles are disgusting so it's always a gamble trying to find one that can be used so my question is can I, as a male, take her into the female toilets? 

Additional information: I don't need to be in the cubicle with her, just need to stand on the other side of the door.
