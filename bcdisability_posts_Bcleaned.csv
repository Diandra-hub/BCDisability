stay away vitality medical,"warning long post incoming believe others know



wow downturn vitality medical taken used best business complete opposite today given several raving reviews years countless purchases including one very 220 order back april time happy so one biggest kickers ordeal beginning biggest concern things work fairly vm too trying rip off get something free

i disabled since 2016 using vitality medical supplies anything covered medicare years now part disability requires usage urinary catheter bags 24x7 typically bags need changed usually twice per month ordered case 20 back april 130 least 10 months worth bags sealed plastic bags remain clean sterile covered additional protective layer white medical paper meaning cannot see urinary bag inside line first bag took case kink it silicone lines bags soft semipliable meaning get kink line longer work

i opened another bag fine used one sometimes get occasional bad bag packaging think anything it going say anything single bad bag figure thats cost business well fast forward month go change bag again open packaging second bag kinked line figured makes two three opened case bode well remaining 18 contact vitality medical surely help fix this

when contact them told lady spoke with cant open bags see many damaged sealed sterile id happy keep track bags case taking pictures documenting bad bag needed could replace number bad bags clearly first two three bad going more hope many would make things even difficult already are honest person never stolen anything life certainly would try rip company previously thought highly of trying get something free though know disability need things purchase ruined box especially todays financial environment

i heard back edmar cabrillos would accepting return order past 30 days return window years past vitality medicals staff always helpful caring knowledgeable clear longer things people clue things company sells used did would understand would literally impossible know many bad bags case first 30 days unless course opened them thus rendering even good bags useless well due sterile seal broken mention literally impossible mentioned see inside packaging containing bags due white paper covering bag

this premise entirely untenable always ordering supplies volume last thing ever want run supplies order many months worth time supplies always sealed sterile meaning cannot view items inside packaging open them longer sterile

so left case bags idea many good vitality medical refusing anything ones know bad people making decisions things clue actually deciding either that going say order past 30 day mark including orders like mine would impossible know item bought them actually damaged not is vitality says oh well eat that mr customer case supposed eat 130

vitality gone knowledgeable helpful caring staff exact opposite former status industry short amount time posting this believe community must look other order others financially hurt situation like this company who quite clear could care less you doubt community likely makes 90 vitality medicals business me surely going others either future look one another companies like vitality medical clearly going to

trouble getting comfortable enough sleep,"

we’ve tried pregnancy pillow style body pillow support body bit reduce pressure stomach doesn’t really like feels she’s stuck one position can’t really move around bed reach rearrange covers she’s hot cold whatever even injury liked either hold hold she’s sleeping pillow makes level closeness difficult moment she’s uncomfortable bed i’ve trying keep bit later drops sofa we’re watching tv reading isn’t really expectation fall asleep doesn’t fuss getting comfortably falls asleep naturally needs however can’t every night don’t like leave spend night living room i’ve going sleep floor isn’t ideal

there’s single sleeping position works consistently every night sometimes get comfortable back takes hour massaging hands shoulders  fall asleep nights end sitting either lie lap sit next head shoulder goes sleep surprisingly quickly like that sometimes lie left side especially lie facing cuddle her however requires stay awake longer we’ve long day doze soon head hits pillow 

any advice finding comfortable position fall asleep would appreciated clarify she’s fallen asleep she’s night doesn’t want strongly medicated she’s put strong tranquillisers sedatives pain meds past hates disconnected make feel she’ll use surgeries she’s sick hospital everyday thing moment occasionally takes melatonin bed time she’s generally sleepy night uncomfortable melatonin obviously doesn’t take away discomfort regular prescribed pain meds stay top them

feel like old dog shelter broken toy bottom garage sell bin,"i’m 32f i’ve spent entire life day existed hurting

i remember 5 swing set slowly rotating put hands swing set chains back arms would burn less could play longer

i remember feeling legs night little kid burning pounding heart beat them

i remember days crying counselors office couldn’t hold pencil “right” way forced write page page way gripped pencil wrong right way hurt much

i figured that’s life normal

weekends stayed resting long weeks school week days couldn’t wait sit bottom shower

i treated lazy

when turned 18 joined army served 7 painful years kept head hurt quietly figured weak one else ever spoke hurting way did

every ruck hips burned burned much couldn’t sleep night long rucks i’d fight back tears pain felt like steaming inside bones

then first baby 25 
my heart pounded chest half way through standing hell trying breathe felt like someone sitting chest existing pain

but saw lots pregnant women fine kept mouth shut

my dad used joke knew around corner cracking sounds body would make walked

but wanted overcome wanted strong wanted normal pushed hard everything had 

i angry

i wanted prove everyone else wasn’t lazy effortless type


so trained day night matter much hurt pushed 

i ran marathons
i climbed mountains
i hike weights back
i ran weights chest

i worked 46 hours day 46 days week next 9 years

i landed modeling gigs
i kept 18 body fat times
i never tipped toed 115lbs
i counted every macro every calorie out

but body slowly dissolved

every pain doctors said fake
every cardiac event called anexity
every seizure told stress
every burst vein told unknowingly holding breath
every time right side face fell would call code stroke i’d sent home questioning sanity

you couldn’t top fitness crippling ill young healthy female said over

then got pregnant son

my hips dislocated every week 
nightly i’d grab wall twist shoulder back socket

soon enough needed chair shower sink kitchen

towards end wheelchair

the pain consuming calm i’d read assisted suicide

just feel control option escape body existed pain allowing happen

at night i’d crawl floors last month pregnancy

the bed soft lay long anyone side i’d hear snap another bone pushed place

my heart weak stand long valves leaking hole found “floppy” heart pressed open wide blood pressure

they said heart like whirlpool

so cannula nose i’d crawl like wounded animal floor piling reshaping pillows blankets desperately attempting make nest hold body place sun came up

and i’d accept defeat taking norco dim pain long enough block suicidal escapist thoughts desperation would bring

every time i’d swallow pill i’d look pregnant belly feeling failure life long weakness one else seem have

every night began routine long could keep oxygen could sit chair shower questioning sanity validity pain

was pain even real weak poisoning baby pain pills

burdening husband overplayed complaints agony manifesting

why could stop it fucking stop hurting stop complaining fucking strong

my abs gone

in place dozens tiny bruises nightly lovenox injections

covered shame i’d waddle past husband pill dispenser

the pretty model outdoors wife signed shambles without knowing tied life long mess crumbles soon it’s reassembled 

i way

in way everything loved 

the outdoors brought us together 
the lucid mind meaningful conversation 
the pretty trophy wife stand side
the adventurous active catch gone

i dead weight pulling away career loved

i distraction photo could perfect tied embarrassment become

i fit picture made wanted 

so cried pain quietly could

my pride dead
my dignity left


and worked make it

my heart couldn’t take another day sent surgery baby 

my poor baby given broken breathless mother

and carry night twist knee caps crack tendons

and sit finally get sleep carefully wait sinks arms well enough know sound bending wrists back place won’t wake him

the world loved shallow loved always fleeting

but loved heart drive strength found go places things people never do

and i’m this

something else

a thing way

a tired worn wife way husbands work reputation paddle boarding weekly errands

i fear baby walk slowly come towards age realizing tired am

i believe disabled neurodivergent point mom thinks point need controlled sheltered like this try telling mom that even told legal advice sub left home mom could call cops bring back tell im incompetent itll word mine since im officially diagnosed mental disability

but socially unacceptable accuse somebody lying rape as be socially acceptable accuse disabled neurodivergent adult lying disabled neurodivergent also accuse lying situation overbearing parents shelters let hardly anything typical adults or even teens matter gets do something fathom imagine mean happening different accusing sex abuse victim domestic violence victim lying since still accusing somebody lying something experiencing going through experienced went through

yes mom allows phone controlling overbearing is check it found something approve such social media dating sites behind back take phone least try to tell cant talk talk people behind back the people like approve of usually superficial judgy reasons ive accused using sock puppet accounts pictures public everyone see profile picture usually peace sign animal flower well im sorry offended im trying keep people knows irl coming across profile telling mom which happen years ago back lot less careful yes 18 then

yes im bumble app saved money pay bumble premium lifetime fee pay one time paid google play card could hide profile people swipe right sees profile im careful swipe right on reduces risk mom finding im bumble meet anyone like course tell mom met app

yes get home alone always makes sure tell keep doors locked leaves invite anyone im home alone like want to finds it last time staying home alone

this senior design project back mechanical engineering undergrad time focused starting career graduated give much thought recently ive hobby designing 3d printing come mind good challenging design project could potentially help people back day reached good friend mine works many disabled people gave useful critiques tools

 existing design give user easy way get whatever held grabber people either complicated motion grab item hand drop item 
 requires user hold trigger entire time maintain grip item
 puts lot strain users wrist pick item
 expense large consideration since disability makes hard find work insurance reluctant pay tools

i ideas address issues

 retraction mechanism allow tool bring object close user
 lock grip let user release trigger without dropping item
 add arm brace increased stabilityreduced wrist strain similar cuffs forearm crutches
 design many parts 3d printed possible
 open source design allow others modify manufacture improve however want to

3d printing become extremely popular accessible area public libraries least one 3d printer theyll make parts cost filament quite cheap im hoping landed cost less 30 make accessible possible intend make money project goals create something useful hone design skills 

i invite anyone interested share experiences tools give kind feedback recommendations may useful let know think features listed would helpful think theyd waste effort id particularly like find people would willing give feedback throughout design process interested please message me",5,1erhhkt,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1erhhkt/seeking_input_on_design_project_from/,1,2024-08-13 15:55:28

review project relate voiceitt speechtotext apps speech differences,"hey all trying accessibility tools speech disabilities figured i’d give indepth review two apps i’ve trying recently project relate voiceitt originally wrote review r headandneckcancer figured may useful broader range people reposting mod blessing

httpssitesresearchgooglerelatehttpssitesresearchgooglerelate

httpswwwvoiceittcomhttpswwwvoiceittcom

voiceitt project relate 2 speechtotext ai platforms aimed people speech differences basic concept tools prerecord predetermined phrases you’ve recorded minimum number ai model voice trained start speaking ai able transcribe you’re saying realtime allow dictate longer written texts provide captions real time

tldr review like tools lot current alternatives strengths weaknesses tech still relatively new lot potential think might help you i’d recommend giving try you’re able invest time training

as disclaimer near total glossectomy i’m missing functionally tongue fairly significant speech impediment people understand little effort 20 minutes conversation i’m scientist use technical language time i’m regularly teaching people aren’t used voice first heard apps wanted help conversations one one use subtitles presenting also don’t disabilities also trying wasn’t planning write review might completely comprehensive opinion mileage may vary

 set training

first off project relate currently available android app it’s beta moment voiceitt or voiceitt2 specifically hand web app accessed multiple devices it’s dependent internet connection project relate free writing voiceitt free trial period charges monthly

i found easy simple set up clear instructions big buttons pr downloaded app store whereas email local distributor adaptit uk voiceitt get account hassle offer mode someone helping set up voiceitt also offers additional accessibility tools didn’t personally explore

i won’t lie you training takes boring voiceitt requires minimum 200 phrases pr says need 500 generated first model around 300 cases took around 3 hours cumulatively take long record like record 20 5 phrases day whatever that’s big deal skip phrases don’t want record apps “say” phrase say it voiceitt maximum timer long take say phrase phrases felt short me

once you’ve trained minimum apps let record custom phrases that’s great teaching things like people’s names locations specific vocabulary game changer reception desks hospital appointments also work project relate lets letters numbers basic punctuation custom phrases teach address voiceitt allows letters voiceitt offers shortcut phrase could say short phrase write longer message  cool

the minimum minimum train better works variable based specific speech 700 phrases pr still says understanding voice “medium” find that’s fine occasional use

 using ai

once you’re trained up start using ai either speak ai write down speak ai repeat loud voiceitt also splits functionality conversation mode dictation mode conversation mode shorter phrases dictation longer speaking

pr seems process audio word word popping immediately speak voiceitt seems wait finish phrase sentence transcribing experience often makes accurate slightly slower apps better shorter phrases frequent pauses struggle longer speak uninterrupted apps make mistakes fairly regularly improve train phrases

i found voiceitt conversation mode really worked really short sentences  would split sentence onto 2 screens wasn’t helpful me mostly used dictate mode coped well technical phrases taught them never really tried options ai repeated thought said loud could see function appealing people

voiceitt also offers function text flipped upside phone flat front person read thought neat

what wanted apps ability change font size could make text bigger someone away or accessibility reasons something “speech assistant” texttospeech app use well miss these

both ais struggled background noise conversations nearby wind music vehicle posed additional challenges situations used alternative tools

 additional functions

along would call “core function” able dictate app app write live transcript tools offer additional functions

transcription outside app voiceitt chrome extension use webpages could use dictate emails write forums etc project relate relate keyboard use dictate apps android device incredible also challenges typing fatigue motor disabilities etc didn’t try out

smart assistants pr lets speak google assistant phone ask weather set timer etc don’t think moment integrates google home devices haven’t tried voiceitt doesn’t website points app repeat said loud help speak smart home devices presumably also true pr something i’ll play future used love silly voicecontrolled lights see game changer disability affects mobility

integration video call apps voiceitt webex offers integration video call apps like microsoft teams zoom didn’t try job entirely inperson rarely video meetings future changes would one important features me functions would popup video call people could read transcription speak holding phone person come additional cost

 additional comments verdict

both services worked well me alternative occasions people struggling understand me often pause write down live transcription made conversations much fluid apps make mistakes improve train more feedback receive people speaking even app wrong provides hint saying found people became used voice faster stopped needing aids sooner often conversation

there situations apps struggle tried use voiceitt tool recently presenting large group meeting slide deck voiceitt app took part screen space separate slide deck feedback much happening screen apps struggle long uninterrupted speech make mistakes improve technology improves would love see integration future dictation looks like movie subtitles slide deck conversations quiet places people aren’t used voice immeasurably valuable

customer support contacted teams thorough efficient voiceitt’s distributors also offer additional support need it spirit nothing us without us staff speech differences involved project speech therapy experts involved

voiceitt subscriptionbased cost there paying would likely fall “reasonable accommodations” work school grants many places support paying type technology

for myself i’ve chosen stick project relate now i’m keeping close eye voiceitt see new features offers ever swap job frequent video call meetings i’ll probably go back voiceitt see incredible potential technology still relatively new improve next years you’re long training process think worth shot

good morning

i signing document requesting appeal due changes happened regarding denial reason reasonable accommodation request form 

the first reason denial would like address covering receptionists lunch fridays 1245 pm 115 pm well providing emergency coverage receptionist able cover front desk 1245 pm 500 pm thursdays fridays due workload expressed concern supervisor reassured would cover reception emergency coverage since would become busy beginning monday august 5th running friday june 6th would also like note reception schedule changed time developed august 2023 day write email meaning reception actual issue came medical accommodation denial

the second reason denial prep clinical staff welcome boxes took full week order materials put boxes together writing email boxes finished time put boxes vehicle transport school sites officially hands till next year late july

something mentioned denial letter brought accommodation meeting breakdown program charts completed breaking archiving programs charts time email learned recently project group effort put couches office sometime september year informed facilitator project help program specialists break archive charts till program becomes active next week

another reason brought meeting ability complete projects outside program unfortunately week august 5th june 5th time spare work anything directly impact program since largest volume work fellow norcal program specialists could confirmed managers well anyone access organizations data need complete project outside program would need facilitated program director ensure holding clinicians work participants

with said seems actual reason deny medical accommodations since employer position accommodations first approved engage additional conversations discussing validity severity disability provided information required accommodations request first approved without question included reception coverage schedule time accommodations request approved well one week proving reception schedule changed preventing approval again

i would like another conversation told multiple times employees impacted decision deny disability accommodation brought accommodations meeting topic dismissed told supervisor misspoke would like understand misspoke thing multiple occasions direct supervisor informed lengths accommodations decision 

i would like keep correspondence email

my folks recently recognized actually truly disabled making things get things im glad finally did they mainly mother still treat adult mind you pay food belongings everything use cannot utilities rent yet two partners 26 amab both help care visit frequently help hang out folks know dating due past bad behavior partners trouble starts come in

for long used share room sleep together problem initially previous mentioned bad behavior directed last partner staying me mother forbidding that proceeding cause issues now her stay even abiding rule now one aunts sister got divorced move us while totally fine like her likes partners even like here issue directly younger reputation family gossip grown since then mother actually issue here placed rule partners cannot sleep room aunt here citing worries aunt go tell mother highly religious grandmother start problems like that abiding too supposedly going 3 months coming month 5

the reason issue stay help physical labor cant myself appropriate place sleep sleep couches family room us nocturnal one working night shift besides couches short narrow each 6ft tall room gets full force rising sun large windows disrupts sleep also get woken everyone area mornings wake little sleep usually pain condition help me obviously also miss sleeping twin beds places little privacy sucks also believe aunt far longer stated prettying place quite extensively

so try talk mother it unfortunately mother narcissistic personality disorder and unsurprisingly get help it conversations ever expressing needs wishes make even slightly uncomfortable always resulted blowing making things worse result usually full insults threats yelling father back either ever go her passive enabler simply even disagrees her also said cited worry grandmother motive frequently ulterior motive want mention puts bad faith display jealousy issues people life said many times outright also stated during exgirlfriends stay get sleep next anyone folks separated why get to know worry theres unsaid second reason imposed new rule

so im unsure even situation couple options see none particularly good ones could allowed sleeping first place acting thats totally normal business usual kinda fair could go ask aunt sleeping would bother her politely ask mention grandmother believe shed reasonable it even mention mothers motive would possibly view throwing bus usurping way could go speak father again really produce results response i go mother

i dunno im really lost mixed feelings validity feelings issue right adult privileges house live finally get out whenever is feel like boundaries goes private area im unsure get live them im grateful that still feel like say goes life

sorry long read rant lot context complicated moving parts this appreciate polite feedback advice simple understanding thanks reading

because severity sister‘s disability collecting social security well government health insurance medicaid since young adult turned 18 parents obtained legal guardianship need constant care child special needs extremely expensive decades parents always managed make ends meet retirement severely limited income themselves luckily make decent money able help financially especially entered mid 20s established career more 

in 2021 sarah got incredibly sick developed respiratory issue lungs producing much co2 enough oxygen almost died hospital doctors gave trach put ventilator condition slowly improved time still trach uses ventilator night doctors clear us would take transition completely vent could looking timeline year longer ready come back home 

after sarah nursing home six months dad mentioned state insurance longer covering full cost nursing home getting billed couple hundred dollars month offered help these dad accepted periodically but weren’t telling full story quick bills piling up earlier week dad called stressed out apparently there’s outstanding bill nursing home 15000 apparently bill steadily rising dad hesitant ask i’ve already helped quite lot year make good salary cannot cover 15000 even covering half would serious hit savings 

my dad particularly upset nursing home’s billing department gone sister‘s room asking outstanding bill sarah cognitive functioning comparable 8 year old sister barely understands concept bills sarah meltdown dad thinking taking loan house pay this told pause instead connected organizations nonprofits offer combination financial aid well legaladvocacy services caretakers severe disabilities also connected local state rep state senator hopefully provide insight additional state resources

he following contacts thought would come well there’s immediate question handle current 15k outstanding medical bill wondering anyone else thread experienced similar issues funding residential care adults special needs familiar resources could point us to… grant programs financial aid etc

this experience also illuminates bigger picture questions finance sister’s complex medical needs long term speaking colleague also sister severe special needs shocked still trying pay costs pocket explained that parents died rest siblings explored legal options found sister made ward state eligible state provide better medical care as opposed siblings fund pocket however varies state state live illinois

my parents wondering reasses dad legal guardianship sister don’t know much longer continue keep costs don’t think fund nursing home care well support children parents gone

best way portray disability creative writing,"hi im nondisabled creative writer currently planning story multiple disabled characters or least considered disabled world want portray disabilities realistically respectfully possible im sorry post long

here current philosophy writing disabled characters  please point anything need change add id love hear it

 a character defined disability disability make identity theres much character soandso condition example character female likes golf cat lover enthusiastic energetic deaf one ear deaf one ear part define whole character

 they still treated like normal people despite accommodated showered sympathy pity every waking moment lives

 if something bad disability exempt it accordance point above disabled excuse bad actions 

 a disability all nothing thing characters partially disabled

 disabilities need backstories long tragic backstories necessary 

 simple things normal people overlook extremely difficult certain disabilities im definitely planning normal people or people considered normal world least interact disabled people gradually understand simple things like putting shoes communication etc much harder them

 depending culture stereotypes etc disabled people probably treated badly certain cases or reverse  disabled people treated much sympathy point becomes sickening

 no magically cure disabilities sake yay happy ending hate trope want honest unless done super well

i feel like im missing lot important points here

current ideas characters

 young boy whose medical condition prevents using specific ability called true singing makes disabled well gives physical side effects impact daily basis im thinking chronic pain mobility issues despite this hes managed create fulfilling life outside disability even collaborating professional true singers actually gets along pretty well hates receiving pity disability

 deeply embittered woman part faction disabled typically incapable using true singing ability somewhat antagonistic treating anyone normal terribly also infuriated disabled individuals passionately hate normal people pretty much everyone outcast faction hates terrible attitude complete lack empathy despite considered disabled themselves

in last six months noticed partner calls upon disability explain away concerns dynamic behaviors example would conversations around housework selfcare asked start putting dishes dishwasher shower change clothes says “babe disability prevents forming habits like that” asked repeatedly stop things like licking pinching making mouth noises ear feel like sensory nightmares me brushes off saying “i disability literally makes impulsive can’t stop it” 

when try broach conversations around coping skills therapy resiliency skills ends conversation saying “have tried using planner” mocking tone medication struggle result neurological side effects don’t conversation much anymore
