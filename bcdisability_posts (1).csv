"Friend still needs ""adult supervision"" whenever we hang out, despite being 18","So this weekend there is going to be a carnival in my hometown and I (20) invited one of my friends (18) to hang out with us. Sadly, she cannot make it tomorrow night but for future reference, she told me she needs ""adult supervision"" if we were to hang out, even with a group of friends. I have high-functioning autism and I know she also has some sort of neurodiversity/disability (I'm not exactly sure what she has but I know for sure she was in more special ed classes than I was in high school). I talked to her about this recently and she told me it's because ""her mom said so"". I felt a little uncomfortable and caught off guard when she told me this because neurodivergent/disabled young adults that still live at home, including those with autism, shouldn't be treated like children anymore. I've hung out with other friends so many times without any supervision required. I don't know if that's on her disability or her parents but this just doesn't feel right.",21,1eyyjum,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eyyjum/friend_still_needs_adult_supervision_whenever_we/,30,1724371206.0

"I want to work, but my disabilities are incompatible with pretty much any job.  ","I walk with a cane or rollator. I have severe IBS that can land me in the bathroom for hours at a time or in bed with severe pain, and we haven't found a proper trigger, even with a colonoscopy. My chronic fatigue and fibro are so bad that often there are entire days where I cannot leave the house or do much other than rest and sometimes write. My issues are so bad that IHSS gives me 96 hours a month. 

I had a part-time job that accommodated me very well. Let me use my aids. Gave me so much sick time. But even that doesn't matter. I've been on short term disability for over a month now and I know I can't come back. And I hate it, so much. I'm going to miss my students, I'm going to miss my schedule. I want to make a difference in the world, not just rot at home.

And I don't know if SSDI will approve me, because on my best days I am capable of doing work, and I could technically maybe do some work from home jobs for a bit before I was fired for getting sick too often. I fully expect to be dead weight for most of the rest of my life, and I don't even know if I can get disability. Sometimes I wonder why I even bother. I'm just a waste of potential. Everyone thought I'd do amazing things. But this stupid, horrible body has failed me. I've failed me. I've failed everyone.

I know that our worth is not how much I work. I'm a radical leftist who believes everyone deserves a safe and happy life. But I don't like living my life not being able to put what I want to into the world, and I also do not live in a utopia and instead live in a country that sees disabled people as drains.

My Dad refuses to help me find a group home for my adult autistic brother. ,"Hello reddit. I am in a situation where I am not sure what to do, or what could happen to me for the future.

To start, I (27F) have an older autistic brother (31M) who lives with my dad (55) and my grandma(81) takes care of him part time. My mom passed away in 2022 so she is not in the picture. The issue is, my dad absolutely refuses to help me look for a group home for my brother after he dies, or any type of assisted living at all. My brother can't work or drive and he basically acts like a child. He's always home and always on his computer doing nothing. He can handle basic hygiene but he can't really cook for himself. To sum it up he can't live alone at all. My dad has been abusive in the past physically, he constantly talks down to me, and he has been a heroin addict since like the mid 2000's. He is not fit to be a parent. My grandma is 81 and my grandpa just passed away in June, and this was kind of a wake up call to me to start planning for my brother. I wrote my dad a huge letter stating how I will not he caring for my brother and he has to find other plans. I showed him a great assisted living place by me and I told him his case worker can help him find housing for my brother. He told me to fuck off and to not contact him and to stay out of this. What will happen if no plan is set and my other family dies? I don't trust my dad to do anything. He says he has other plans but refuses to tell me. My brother currently receives SSI and he had medicaid and a case worker which is good news, and he is diagnosed with autism as well so it is on record. I just am so scared of them dying and them having absolutely nothing set up for my brother. My family lives in poverty and they don't have any money saved up. Not sure if this information helps but I am located in Ohio. How can I force my dad to start making plans? Should I call adult protective services or report this to his case worker? Will he be forced on me if they die? Will I have to take him in or will the state make him a ward of the state and find him placement? Any advice will help me please. I want to start taking action now

Must be able to drive :/,"I’m American living in the south so this question won’t apply to everyone, but why on earth is it legal for jobs that do not involve driving as part of your duties to require that you are capable of driving and own a car?

but why on earth do I need a drivers license and a working car to be able to work a medsurg nursing job that doesn’t involve driving as far as I can tell from the description and duties listed?? 

This isn’t the first time I’ve seen it and it feels unfair. My husband reliably drives me where I need to go, it’s not like not being able to drive means I don’t have reliable transportation. And what about the people that can drive but don’t own a car?? I just don’t get why that’s an okay standard to throw in there.

how do i tell my parents i need mobility aids?,"i (15, ftm) experience on and off pain in my back, legs, and ankles. i’ve been to an orthopedic doctor and she said the structure of my feet is fine, but i can bend them in ways she’s never seen. ive talked with my primary care doctor about the pain and she just says i need to exercise more often. my body is in pain after walking short distances, and im worried because im starting at a new, larger school this September.

I go to a summer camp every summer, and a lot of people there struggle with cronic pain and illness. when i’ve expressed my struggles, they suggested talking to my parents about possibly getting a cane and some braces for my legs. my question is how do i approach the situation?

i think my mom will be more supportive of my needs, but will want me to try to stick it out. i don’t want to force myself to do things that i physically cannot do without pain. my dad on the other hand will think i’m lying for attention and because im young im healthy. i just want to be able to move like my peers do. 

im in marching band at my high school, and im so tired after 1-3 reps of movement. i know something is wrong, but none of the adults in my life believe me. i don’t want to have to take advil every night because im sore anymore. i can’t walk very long without needing to sit or lean on something, and my feet get very tired after a short time of standing.

I am a disabled senior with 3 cats,"Hi. I am a disabled 61 year old senior and have til the end of the month to vacate my unit of 10 years. 

A bit of my backstory. I had a roomie that lost her job and hadn’t paid rent since November of last year. I was really struggling after she left, but was making my bills - barely. I applied for 2 different assistance programs because I ended up bouncing April’s rent check. I tried to work with my landlord by paying my current month plus an additional $500 a month til I would be paid in full. It would have taken me current 4+months to get. But, my landlord refused all payments - he wanted all or vacate premises. Now I’m 6 months past due with no where to turn. My 3 cats and I will be homeless at the end of this month and I am so scared. Unfortunately I was born and raised in So Cal, which is NOT the cheapest place to live. I have zero monies for a security deposit and who is going to rent to me when I owe my current landlord approx $7,000. Then, just to make things more interesting in my boring life, I was (uninsured) frauded which took all of my savings. I’m usually a very positive glass half full type person, but I’m really struggling. I know there are people out there with way worse problems than I currently have, but I feel like there’s no where to turn.

Stay away from Vitality Medical,"Warning, long post incoming, but I believe others here should know.



Wow, what a downturn Vitality Medical has taken, they used to be the best in the business, they are the complete opposite of that today. I have given them several raving reviews over the years, from countless purchases, including one for this very, $220, order back in April, and at the time I was happy to do so. One of the biggest kickers in this ordeal, is that in the beginning, my biggest concern was that things work out fairly for VM too, I wasn't trying to rip them off, or get something for free.

I have been disabled since 2016, and I have been using Vitality Medical for most of my supplies, anything that wasn't covered under Medicare for years now. Part of my disability requires my usage of urinary catheter bags, 24x7. Typically, these bags need to be changed out usually twice per month. I ordered a case of 20, back in April, $130, at least 10 months worth. These bags are sealed in plastic bags, so that they remain clean and sterile, and covered in an additional protective layer of white medical paper, meaning you cannot see the urinary bag inside. The line on the very first bag I took out of the case had a kink in it. The silicone lines on these bags are soft and semi-pliable, meaning when you get a kink in the line, it will no longer work.

I opened another bag, and it was fine, so I used that one. Sometimes you get an occasional bad bag out of the packaging, so I didn't think anything about it. I am not going to say anything over a single bad bag, I figure that's the cost of doing business. Well, fast forward to this month, I go to change my bag again, open the packaging, and a second bag with a kinked line. I figured that makes two out of three that I have opened from this case, that does not bode well for the remaining 18, I should contact Vitality Medical, surely they will help fix this.

When I contact them, I told the lady I spoke with, that I can't open all of the bags to see how many are damaged, as they are sealed and sterile, and that I'd be happy to keep track of the bags in this case, taking pictures and documenting each bad bag, if needed, so that they could just replace the number of bad bags. Clearly, with the first two out of three being bad, there is going to be more, I just hope it isn't too many, because it would make things even more difficult than they already are. I am a very honest person, I have never stolen anything in my life, I certainly would not try to rip off a company that I previously thought so highly of, I am not just trying to get something for free, though most here will know that being on disability, I need for the things that I do purchase to not be ruined out of the box, especially in today's financial environment.

I just heard back from an Edmar Cabrillos, that they would not be accepting a return on my order, as it is past the 30 days return window. In years past, Vitality Medical's staff were always very helpful, caring, and knowledgeable, it is clear that they are no longer any of those things. They now have people with no clue as to how any of the things their company sells are used, if they did, they would understand that it would literally be impossible for me to know how many bad bags I had out of that case in the first 30 days, unless, of course, I opened all of them, thus rendering even the good bags useless as well due to the sterile seal being broken. Not to mention it is literally impossible, as I mentioned, to see inside of the packaging containing the bags, due to the white paper covering each bag.

This premise is entirely untenable, as I am always ordering my supplies in volume, the last thing I ever want is to run out of supplies, so I order many months worth at a time. All of my supplies are always sealed, and sterile, meaning I cannot view the items inside the packaging, and if I open them, they are no longer sterile.

So, now I am left with a case of bags, that I have no idea just how many of them are good, but Vitality Medical is refusing to do anything about the ones that we know are bad. Because they have people making decisions on these things, who have no clue what they are actually deciding. Either that, or they are just going to say no to any order past the 30 day mark, including orders like mine, where it would be impossible to know if the item you bought from them, was actually damaged, or not. If it is, Vitality says, ""Oh, well, you'll just have to eat that, Mr Customer"", in this case, I am supposed to eat $130.

Vitality has gone from having knowledgeable, helpful, and caring staff, to the exact opposite of their former status in the industry, in a very short amount of time. I am posting this, as I believe our community must look out for each other, in order for others to not be financially hurt by a situation like this, by a company who, it is quite clear, could care less about you. I have no doubt our community likely makes up 90%+ of Vitality Medical's business, and if they are doing this to me, they are surely going to do it to others, either now or in the future. We have to look out for one another, because companies like Vitality Medical clearly are not going to.

Stay far away from Vitality Medical folks, especially those with lingering medical issues that require regular maintenance, they will refuse to stand behind the products they sell you, and will demand the impossible from your side.",4,1ez0x7u,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ez0x7u/stay_away_from_vitality_medical/,0,1724378018.0

Vision accessibility at Edinburgh Fringe Festival,"Hi,

I'm sighted.  I'm preparing a one-person show for next August.  My show involves me talking about a slideshow, and occasionally breaking into song.  The venue will probably seat fewer than 40 guests. 

I figured I would offer an FM signal with a little more info about the slides than I'm likely to say on mic.  It would also describe my costume and the unusual musical instruments I'm using.  The FM audio feed would be pre-recorded for each slide, and I wouldn't hear it while performing.  I pictured someone with limited vision wearing a headset on one ear only, so they could also hear the room well.  I could include the live sound in the broadcast but it's a low budget show and I doubt I'd be giving a super high-quality mix.  

Are blind people as likely as anyone else to travel with a headset?  How about an FM receiving device?  I have a couple old cell phones that receive FM when a headphone wire is hooked up.  I could loan those out. 

Would it make more sense for me to just ask at the beginning of every show how many blind people are in the audience, and just be prepared to insert more verbose explanations into my presentation?  I could warn the venue and the act following me of that plan, and I'd dare them to complain about me running a bit long to make such an accommodation.  The festival has a bad enough reputation about accessibility as it is. 

Thanks for any help and advice,

What is considered “disabled enough” for an IEP? Or any disability services.,"I graduated from HS last year and looking back, there are some things that are confusing. Especially when it came to IEPs.

For reference, I’m diagnosed with two different developmental disabilities and several mental illnesses. This in itself isn’t a reason to qualify but all together, I was unable to function at school.

I couldn’t ride the bus, be in the hallways, or in class without significant issues. It’s hard to explain exactly what the problems were. My grades were failing and I was unable to do classes because I was in too much distress to pay attention. (In the end, I ended up being unable to attend in-person school & staying home with a caregiver/doing online classes.)

The school would not accept diagnosis from outside of the school district. So they did their own testing. When the testing concluded, each time they determined there was no reason I would need an IEP as I didn’t fit the disability criteria. My family tried every year to get me an IEP, but the same result came every time. All the way through middle and high school.

I’m wondering if maybe I wasn’t disabled enough. I have level 1 autism which is often considered too high functioning for aid. And mental illness is just considered “other” rather than disability. 

If I wasn’t disabled enough for an IEP, then I wouldn’t be disabled enough for accommodations (if I went to college) or for government aid. Which is concerning because I cannot work at all, I can barely leave my home. I have to have family with me to go to even doctor’s appointments. I am medicated and in various different therapies, I have been for a long time. But I’m still unable to function properly, yet I’m not considered disabled?

I don’t know. Back to an IEP, what do you have to be? Do you have to be blind, deaf, or have an intellectual disability to have one? Do you have to have more severe autism? What is considered “disabled enough” for an IEP or any disability services?",6,1eysoqp,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eysoqp/what_is_considered_disabled_enough_for_an_iep_or/,6,1724356056.0

Camping while disabled/after surgery,"Hi y’all! My troop is going to a camporee this fall, which I am attending (it is not possible for me to not go). The kicker is, I’ll have just had ACL surgery a few weeks ago.

Do y’all have any tips on navigating tents while on crutches/in a wheelchair?

For context, this camporee is entirely accessible. My troop will be in an accessible campsite, most things will be paved as it is in a city, and besides grass I will not be encountering any rough terrain. I was initially very skeptical, but my troop has had conversations with the camporee organizers (which include the mayor of the city and the national park organization) and they say it is no problem. The entire thing will be wheelchair accessible except for my actual tent. I will be bringing a cot to make things easier.

Also as a note I am a youth and my troop/adult leaders have assured me this will not be a problem. My mother will be attending (not just for me she is an adult leader), and we are going to reach out to council and ask for permission to share a tent. 

Please remember to be nice while answering. I understand this may be a stupid question, but do not answer if you do not have actually advice. I understand is selfish, but please do not feel the need to call me selfish/a jerk/etc.

Rollators and wheeled luggage?,"I have EDS and finally got my first rollator a month ago. It's been absolutely amazing especially for attending concerts which I plan on doing this weekend, however this one's in another town and I'll have to take the train with my rollator and my wheeled luggage, which I've never done before and can't figure out how??

When I'm using just my walking cane it's fairly easy, one hand on the cane and the other hand on the luggage handle. But how do I do that with both hands on my rollator handles?

Feeling lonely ,"I’m a 20-year-old man and I’m high functioning on the autism spectrum. I wanted to reach out to this community because I’ve been feeling really lonely and sad lately, and I think sharing my feelings might help.

I don’t have any friends, and it often feels like I’m navigating life all on my own. I’ve tried to connect with people, but it seems really difficult for me to form lasting friendships. On top of that, my family rarely reaches out to me or calls, which makes the loneliness even harder to bear. I often find myself wishing for someone to talk to or share experiences with, but it feels like I’m just drifting through life without that connection.

I know that many of you may have faced similar feelings, so I’m hoping to find some understanding or advice from this community. How do you cope with feelings of loneliness? Are there any strategies or activities that have helped you connect with others or feel less isolated? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I really appreciate any thoughts or support you might have.",3,1eywwx5,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eywwx5/feeling_lonely/,4,1724366815.0
How do I get doctors to fill these forms out? ,"I'm trying to apply for disability for the 3rd time here and part of what was being a pain last time was my doctor's seem to dig their heels in and *refuse* to fill out *anything pertaining to disability at all.

What to do when applying for the first time ,"So my partner has had a hard life, especially financially. From what I understand,when he first graduated high school and tried to go to college, he filled out all the paperwork about his family's situation, and he was essentially told that there was no way that his family survived on what was reported, so he had to be lying, and he was banned for applying for any federal assistance for years. That has had him very gunshy about trying anything else. 

Together, we're in a much better place financially, but due to several undiagnosed issues, both physical and mental, he cannot work, and so we need to get him on disability, or at least try to. He doesn't have health insurance. I told him to just go apply, because I assume getting a denial letter is the first step of trying to get the process started of we wanted to go through a lawyer route. He's hesitant to do that without any proof because of what happened with college.

He says that he needs to go to a doctor first, to get a physician to sign off on the things that would qualify him for disability, and that requires money for an appointment. I was under the impression that if you apply, then the state pays for you to see an approved physician to verify if you're full of shit or not.

Trouble getting comfortable enough to sleep,"
My sweet wife was severely injured in an accident four years ago. She’s doing pretty well all things considered but struggles with getting comfortable to sleep at night. To clarify, she has very few issues with actually sleeping but can’t really lie comfortably anymore which makes it difficult for her to relax enough to sleep even when she’s very tired. Before her injuries, she would lie on her right side every night but because her right leg was badly damaged, it hurts too much for her to put this much pressure on it. She’s had so many abdominal surgeries that her belly is pretty much always slightly swollen and tender, so obviously painful to lie on. Lying on her back is also pretty uncomfortable for her and she likes to be kind of curled up. Unfortunately, even on her side, she can’t really bend her legs enough to get comfortable like that. 

We’ve tried a pregnancy pillow style body pillow to support her body a bit more and reduce the pressure on her stomach, but she doesn’t really like this as she feels she’s stuck in one position and can’t really move around in bed, reach to rearrange the covers if she’s too hot or cold or whatever. Even before her injury, she liked to either hold me or have me hold her when she’s sleeping, and the pillow makes that level of closeness difficult. At the moment, she’s so uncomfortable in bed that I’ve been trying to keep her up a bit later so she just drops off on the sofa, because when we’re watching tv or reading, there isn’t really that same expectation to fall asleep and so she doesn’t fuss about getting comfortably and just falls asleep naturally when she needs. However, I can’t do this every night. Because I don’t like to leave her to spend the night by herself in the living room, I’ve been going to sleep on the floor which isn’t ideal.

There’s no single sleeping position that works consistently every night. Sometimes, I can get her comfortable on her back but it takes about an hour of me massaging her hands and shoulders  for her to fall asleep. Other nights, I end up sitting up so she can either lie in my lap or sit next to me with her head on my shoulder, and she goes to sleep surprisingly quickly like that. She can sometimes lie on her left side, especially if I lie facing her and cuddle her. However, most of this requires me to stay awake longer than she does and if we’ve had a long day, I just doze off as soon as my head hits the pillow. 

Any advice on finding a comfortable position to fall asleep would be appreciated. Just to clarify, once she’s fallen asleep, she’s out for the night. She doesn’t want to be strongly medicated as she’s been put on strong tranquillisers/ sedatives/ pain meds in the past and hates how disconnected they make her feel. She’ll use them after surgeries/ when she’s sick or in hospital but not as an everyday thing. At the moment, she occasionally takes melatonin before bed but not all the time, as she’s generally very sleepy at night but uncomfortable and the melatonin obviously doesn’t take away her discomfort. She has regular prescribed pain meds and we stay on top of them.

"Is it legal for my employer to make me get ""re-certified"" every 6 months for them to provide reasonable accommodations for my permanent disabilities?","For reference, I live in Oregon, US. I work as a cashier/ self-checkout attendant at a retailer. I have hEDS and other comorbidities. My accommodation request was for me to be able to sit down as needed while working. When I originally made this request last summer, I spoke to 3 or 4 different managers who told me that I just needed a doctor's note and that it would be easy to accommodate. (There are other coworkers who use a chair in the same way.) I provided a doctor's note saying that I had permanent disabilities and that I needed to use a chair as needed. I turned in my note to upper management and was then told it wasn't sufficient. She said I would either need to provide a note with an end date within 1 year, or to work with a 3rd party called AbsenceOne to verify the need for a long-term accommodation.  
  
I came back with a note dated within 1 year (through mid-October 2024). I was then told that regardless of the length of time for my accommodation, that I would need to work with AbsenceOne. Long story short, after multiple trips to the doctor, a ton of back-and-forth with management, AbsenceOne, and HR, my employer agreed to make my accommodation permanent. So imagine my surprise when my manager approached me a few weeks ago and said my accommodation is expiring at the beginning of August. I let her know that my accommodation is permanent and that my doctor is always booked for several weeks out, so I wouldn't be able to get the paperwork in time in any case. My manager says she's willing to work with me on the accommodation as long as I can get new paperwork ASAP. I spoke with HR and AbsenceOne again and was told that I need to provide paperwork every 6 months to re-certify my need for accommodation. This seems to conflict with EEOC guidelines unless I'm misinterpreting anything. Has anybody gone through something similar or know if this is a reasonable request from my employer?",1,1eyycr4,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eyycr4/is_it_legal_for_my_employer_to_make_me_get/,4,1724370650.0

Am I rude for feeling like my best friend is inconsiderate of my disability?,"I always keep my friends and family updated but unfortunately not to my best friend. This ""best friend"" of mine is a girl I met online that i've known for 3 years, I have close friends in person but me and her just have so many similar interests. She has no disabilities so it may be hard for her to understand. When we met up in the beginning of this year she had tore her ACL in December right before a big competition in my town that she was supposed to attend. While she was there for a week, she complained about how miserable her life felt not being able to compete and brushed it off laughing about being an athlete girl whos disabled. I felt slightly offended because she was complaining about not being able to do a sport because of a temporary disability while I had to give up on that same sport because my permanent disability progressed and I might never be able to do it again since theres no cure. Yet all the frustration I held in my feelings and never said a word. A couple months later after she's recovered she stops talking to me, we used to call all the time and play video games online when she was recovering from her surgery. Now thats shes in her normal life again all she does is occasionally snap me on snapchat but never offers to call and when I do she says shes busy. This makes me feel worthless to her and I feel like a replacement friend or someone she only talks to when shes bored. She has a busier life than me and travels around the states but that doesn't make it impossible to contact a friend from time to time. Now last week I had entered a clinical trial for my disability and I had to get a punch biopsy for my muscle on my calf. I was telling all my friends and family because I was excited to finally get a chance to help my disability get better. This is the part that annoyed me most, I message her after surgery saying ""The biopsy went well, I think this medicine is really going to work I have hope."" And she replies ""Biopsy for what?"" Now I am confused because I have been telling her this entire month everytime I get updates from my Doctor. I reply ""The biopsy for the trial im in..? For my disability?"" And all she had to say was ""Ohh sorry I forgot."" my response was ""I didn't forget about when you tore your ACL, I was supportive and caring about you."" she said ""I do care about you but you know how I am."" saying that shes forgetful. Now I am pissed off at her because all of my other friends don't act this way and shes the only one who never checks up on me about my trial, she didn't even know when I obviously send her messages that she leaves on opened. She posted on her instagram story stating how its emotional for her to get asked if she has had any past surgeries or injuries. I reply to the story saying ""Some people have it more unfortunate than you, maybe be more happy that you healed from it and can continue doing your sport."" She left my reply on read and hasn't texted me since. Im thinking I was too rude with that comment but she never checks up on me, maybe I am expecting to much out of her.

Inaccessibile invites,"I am feeling so frustrated right now. 
Here's what happening: my boyfriend's brother in law's birthday is tomorrow and I was invited to his birthday party. I knew that the place won't be very accessible but I thought I could make it with help from my bf. I am a manual wheelchair user but I can walk short distances if assisted. I talked to bf about it and we decided we would go. Today, bf calls me and says the location is very beautiful but totally inaccessibile (only reachable by walking down a trail with multiple sets of steep stairs) and the tables are also high and uncomfortable. He says he thinks I should not go because we've been in a similar situation before and it's not been enjoyable for me or for him. He still wants to go without me though because his brother in law is also his best friend.
I don't blame him, but I think his sister should have taken my access needs into account when planning the party/inviting us. Brother in law and I are not super close but we get along, it's not like I wanted a totally accessible location but this seems to be the opposite. Bf says his sister only realized it would be a problem for me after booking because she's not used to 'wheelchair life ' and they want to go there because it's his favorite bar. I don't want bf to miss out on the party because I know it's important for him since he doesn't see his sister and bil often, so I would never ask him not to go. 
I am used to missing out on stuff because of lack of accessibility but when such things happen I still get frustrated and sad because I wish I was able to be there for my bf and his family and experience things together like everyone else.",3,1eynuep,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eynuep/inaccessibile_invites/,2,1724344322.0

"Unpopular Opinion: I hate the toxic positivity in the disability community as a whole, of especially people who never knew what it was like to lose one or more of your senses, telling someone to not process their emotions. ","I'm sorry, but it's so invalidating and ignorant for people in my community for example, the blind and visually impaired, to tell someone how everything they once did has a ""replacement"". Or that dreams and achievements once very important to someone ""won't matter if they just keep moving forward.""

We ARE moving forward, but we all must grieve and let ourselves process the emotions that come with this feeling of loss. If we don't let ourselves feel what we need to feel, the frustration we deny will only bleed into our relationships and form unrealistic expectations about the life ahead.

I will never for get in college for example, a seminar I was in for blind and visually impaired students. At the time my vision was near-perfect, sans the nightblindness. There was this one young woman who was an accomplished long-distance runner who was granted a scholarship for her athletic achievement. She could no longer do that sport however, due to a severe infection that spread to both eyes. I will refer to her as Jane; she was left with total blindness in her left eye and 20/300 vision at best correct, in the right. Another young man I'll call Alex, had been visually impaired since birth; Alex had less than 20 degrees of peripheral vision since birth.

Jane opened up about how devastated she was about losing her vision the prior year, as she could no longer do what she loved the most. Alex chimes in with all manner of ""repplacements"" such as stationary bikes, jumprope, or weightlifting. Those things are forms of activity sure, but they were not what she spent the better part of her youth perfecting, only to have LOST it all. Why would someone not be depressed or anxious, or at the very least need time to process that? Alex went on about how we need to move forward with our lives and that wallowing in your own misery will not help anyone. Mind you, Alex himself never was a track and field athlete, nor was he as accomplished as a student as Jane. I feel it is worth saying that because in my experience, I've come accross blind and visually impaired athletes who would have understood, empathized, and respected Jane's perdicament.

Emapthy to me means that you understand a person has needs outside of your own that they need, in order to thrive. Empathy means you can understand why someone would feel or think about something a certain way, even if it wasn't the thoughts or feelings you yourself would have had.

Mind you, the people being invalidated were already resilient to begin with. I've seen people who worked from the bottom up build strong businesses. Even if disability didn't stop them, they still had to process the new found struggle and talk about it with loved ones. I've seen single parents who provided for and raised their children well for years; especially these people, why wouldn't they be devastated about something like paralysis, blindness, chronic illness or pain, and severe mental illness? Life can still be lived for sure, but resilience can in time be a trauma response, which needs to be treated as such.

In the end, we are humans and have to process emotions as we adapt to our new life. Especially in the disability community as a whole, it is imperative that we support each other and not push on each other the same ableism of society that causes everyone else an isolated quality of life.

As I have always known, the greatest tragedy of disability is not the disability itself, but the ignorance of society's views on those with disability.

It's a shame that even members of our community perpetuate this.

Grieving is as valid an emotion as hope, happiness, and anger.

Lower limb prosthesis in a fantasy novel,"Hi guys, I'm writing a book and one of the characters has to have his lower leg amputated due to a fall. I wanted some advice from those who have experience of this, or something similar, so I can represent this disability accurately. 

For info: it's a medieval esque time period, but has some technology like clocks and blimps. Magic is a resource like any other and can be used, but can't regrow a leg. 

Main things I would like to know:
1) if I were to cut out a chunk of the ""getting used to using his new leg"" time part of having a prosthetic, would that be considered offensive? There is magic in this world, and a wheelchair using character has a magically-power-assisted wheelchair, so I was thinking it would be similar to that, so the learning curve will be shorter? I'm not sure if I feel capable of writing that entire journey, since I've never experienced anything like it, but I'll give it my best shot if that's the consensus 
2) are there any specific things I should know about the healing process or life with a prosthetic that isn't commonly talked about? Particularly within the time period. 
3) would you prefer it to be something that is present from before the start of the book? So, something that is mentioned but normalised? I have another disabled character whose disability has been present throughout. 

I don't want to make this a huge plot point because I want to normalise these characters being disabled, but I still want to make sure I handle this correctly.

"College claims to not be able to provide me a single room, despite my accommodations","I have a variety of disabilities, including urinary incontinence, which makes it quite uncomfortable to live with random people. I refuse to share a room with anyone due to the somewhat embarrassing nature of my disability, and the fact that I've been teased, bullied and harassed by my peers in the past, specifically about my urinary incontinence. I'm okay sharing a general living space with others, so long as I have my room to myself.

For the last two years, I've gotten my urinary doctor to write me a letter for my disabilities stating that I require the single room as part of my accommodations. I've been able to get the single room for the last two years with no issues.

This year, I had quite a lot of issues with the school and financial aid, which left me unable to pay my housing deposit until last week (classes start on September 4th), and therefore without a room, as they do not hold rooms for students, even ones with disabilities.

I found out yesterday that I was assigned to a double room off-campus with somebody I do not know. I do not feel comfortable or even safe sharing a room with somebody I don't know. I reached out to disabilities and told them that I do not feel safe or comfortable in this living situation, and that the single room has been written into my accommodations for the last two years, as well as for the upcoming year.

I was told that I've been put on the priority waitlist for a single, but this is makes me quite anxious, as there's an extremely high chance I could be forced into the double with no other option. They haven't outright said that they're completely out of singles, but given the fact that they didn't just place me in one right away, I'd imagine they have very little or none left.

I'm not the type of person to cause issues, but I'm not quite sure what to do. Is the single room something that the school legally has to give me because it's in my accommodations? Is this something I should even try to argue with the school over?

Edit: Thank you guys!! Everyone's responses have been really helpful. I'm willing to give having a roommate a try, especially since it seems like I don't really have any other option, although I'm still hoping they can do something to get me into a single.

Edit: They got me a single!! Just got an email this morning telling me they had a single for me.",29,1ey0umo,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ey0umo/college_claims_to_not_be_able_to_provide_me_a/,16,1724273928.0

Using a walker in high school,I was recently diagnosed with FND after winding up in the hospital for leg paralysis. I am on the road to recovery but will be using a walker at school to improve safety and reduce pain and fatigue. I  am able to walk by myself but wind up in pain the more I walk and my balance also gets worse the more I walk. This is going to be a temporary thing that I use for a couple of weeks. I have already gotten accommodations for this put in my IEP that I have because I am deaf with 2 cochlear implants. Does anyone have tips on how to deal with other students? This is my first time using a walker at school. I’d also like some tips for how to decorate it. It is a walker with two front wheels. My budget is $20 and I can sew and crochet.

So scared: Can't get APS to help me & about to lose electricity,"I'm so sorry to panic post, but I really need advice. I called APS in Texas for myself a little over a week ago. The person who did the intake said she'd escalate the investigation bc I have an electricity disconnect notice, can't pay rent, and can't get to my walker. (My power was supposed to be disconnected on  8/20, but it's on hold until tomorrow morning due to a heat advisory).   
  
The APS investigator assigned to me came out the next day and rang the doorbell but left before I could get to the door. Since then, he hasn't responded to any phone calls or text messages. I've called the hotline multiple times, and 4 days ago, an on-call investigator showed up, took pictures of my disconnect notice and medical info, made sure I ""had food in the house."" She told me the assigned investigator would be handling everything else and left. 

I don't know what to do. I'm post-TBI, and heat is the main trigger for my vertigo and migraines, which cause me to fall and have resulted in additional concussions, an elbow dislocation, fractured kneecap, etc. over the past year. I relocated to my current city due to domestic violence, and the only person I know here is my 83-year-old mother, who is not only abusive but unable/unwilling to help in any way. I would just go to the hospital, but I have two senior rescue dogs living with me and no one to care for them.

I feel like the old dog at the shelter. The broken toy at the bottom of a garage sell bin.,"I’m 32f. I’ve spent my entire life from the day I existed hurting.

I remember being 5 on the swing set and slowly rotating where I put my hands on the swing set chains so my back and arms would burn less and I could play longer.

I remember the feeling of my legs at night as a little kid just burning and the pounding heart beat in them.

I remember days crying in the counselors office because I couldn’t hold my pencil the “right” way and being forced to write page after page because the way I gripped the pencil was wrong- but their right way hurt so much.

I just figured that’s life. This is normal.

Weekends I stayed in resting from long weeks at school. And week days I couldn’t wait to sit on the bottom of the shower.

I was treated as lazy.

When I turned 18 I joined the Army and served 7 very painful years. But I kept my head down and I hurt quietly. I figured I was being weak because no one else ever spoke about hurting the way I did.

Every ruck my hips burned. They burned so much I couldn’t sleep through the night. After long rucks I’d fight back tears. The pain felt like it was steaming out from the inside of my bones.

Then I had my first baby at 25. 
My heart just pounded out of my chest half way through. Standing was hell. Trying to breathe felt like someone was sitting on my chest. Existing was pain.

But I saw lots of pregnant women doing just fine so I kept my mouth shut.

My dad used to joke he knew when I was around the corner because the cracking sounds my body would make when I walked.

But I wanted to overcome I wanted to be strong I wanted to be normal- so pushed hard with everything I had. 

I was angry.

I wanted to prove it to myself and to everyone else I wasn’t some lazy effortless type.


So I trained day and night no matter how much it hurt I pushed. 

I ran marathons.
I climbed mountains.
I hike with weights on my back.
I ran with weights on my chest.

I worked out 4-6 hours a day 4-6 days a week the next 9 years.

I landed modeling gigs.
I kept under 18% body fat at all times.
I never tipped toed over 115lbs.
I counted every macro and every calorie in and out.

But my body slowly dissolved.

Every pain the doctors said was fake.
Every cardiac event was called anexity.
Every seizure I was told was stress.
Every burst vein I was told was from unknowingly holding my breath.
Every time the right side of my face fell they would call code stroke and I’d be sent home the same questioning my sanity.

You couldn’t be both in top fitness and crippling ill. I was a young healthy female they said over and over.

Then I got pregnant with my son.

My hips dislocated every week. 
Nightly I’d grab a wall and twist my shoulder back into the socket.

Soon enough I needed a chair in the shower, at the sink and in the kitchen.

Towards the end I was in a wheelchair.

The pain was so consuming to calm myself I’d read about assisted suicide.

Just to feel control that the option to escape my body existed and that I only was here in this pain because I was allowing it to happen.

At night I’d crawl the floors the last month of my pregnancy.

The bed was too soft and as I lay too long on anyone side I’d hear the snap of another bone pushed out of place

My heart was too weak to stand long and my valves were leaking. A hole had been found in my “floppy” heart that had been pressed open wide from my blood pressure.

They said my heart was like a whirlpool.

So with my cannula in my nose I’d crawl like a wounded animal on the floor piling and reshaping pillows and blankets desperately attempting to make a nest to hold my body in place until the sun came up.

And then I’d accept the defeat of taking a norco to dim the pain long enough to block out my suicidal escapist thoughts the desperation would bring.

Every time I’d swallow a pill I’d look down at my pregnant belly feeling that same failure that same life long weakness no one else seem to have.

Every night began a routine. How long could I keep off the oxygen so I could sit on that chair in the shower questioning my sanity, the validity of the pain.

Was the pain even real or was it so weak I was poisoning my baby and I with these pain pills.

Burdening my husband with overplayed complaints of agony I was manifesting.

Why could I just stop it. Just fucking stop hurting. Stop complaining. Just be fucking strong.

My abs were gone.

In their place were dozens of tiny bruises from my nightly lovenox injections.

Covered in shame I’d waddle past my husband to the pill dispenser

The pretty model outdoors wife he had signed up for was now in shambles and without knowing it he had tied himself to a life long mess that crumbles as soon as it’s reassembled 

I was in the way

In the way of everything he loved 

The outdoors that brought us together 
The lucid mind for meaningful conversation 
The pretty trophy wife to stand by his side
The adventurous, active catch was gone.

I was dead weight pulling him away from his career he loved.

I was a distraction in any photo of him that could have been perfect had he not tied himself to the embarrassment I had become

I did not fit the picture he had made or wanted 

So I cried in the pain as quietly as I could

My pride was dead
My dignity had left


And all I had worked to make myself with it

My heart couldn’t take another day and so I was sent for surgery to have my baby 

My poor baby who has been given a broken, breathless mother.

And I carry him at night and as I twist my knee caps crack off and on their tendons

And when I sit after I finally get him to sleep I carefully wait until he sinks into my arms well enough I know the sound of me bending my wrists back into place won’t wake him

The world loved me because it was shallow and what it loved me for was always fleeting

But I loved me for my heart, my drive for the strength I found to go places and do things most people never do

And now I’m this.

Something else.

A thing in the way.

A tired worn down wife in the way of my husbands work reputation, his paddle boarding, his weekly errands.

I fear when my baby can walk because he will slowly come towards the age of realizing how tired I am

And my 9 year old has already made it known that I’m like a used up broken down toy that’s borning now.

"AITH'ish post, or OffMyChest, not sure, venting.","I'm severely disabled, severe scoliosis, so it's very obvious. I can't say I don't care how I look. I'm not a vain person, I don't need to be beautiful, I just wish I was less deformed.   

Now, I know what you'll say, most people don't care how I look and that's true to an extent. There's always assholes that wont even hide their disgust, or thoughtless folks that has knee-jerk reactions when they see me, but most people are courteous.  

On to the point of my post...  

I had a bad couple of months. I got bad news, one after the other, so I felt down. For some god forsaken reason I made an account on a dating service.. I guess I wanted to see if I had a ""normal"" physique, would I be attractive, able to get a date, find a partner, a ""what-if"" fantasy..  

After a while I got in touch with someone. Two of them kind of fizzled out, but the third person, she was great. We texted a lot, almost daily, eventually talked, it felt so easy, natural. Common interests, wants, goals, a great match. After the third week it became obvious, I had to tell her the truth. So far I had just danced around the topic, been vague, but she wanted to meet up..  

I knew I had done a shitty thing, and I wont lie, a part of me wanted the fantasy to keep going. Talking with her was a highlight in my day..  

I told her, in a long text, apologizing for my one lie, though a big one.  

After two days I got a text from her. She thanked me for telling her, and that she didn't want any further contact. Wished me well.  

I regret everything, from making that account to the obvious conclusion. I feel like an asshole for not considering other peoples feelings, I feel worse now than I did before. I don't know how to move on from this, I don't want to live the life I'm heading for.

Advice on my potential medical malpractice case?,"I’m copying and reposting what the mods removed from r/legaladvice, which is dumb because I used the medicine and malpractice flair they provide only to be told medical malpractice has no place on their sub.  

Hi all, I’ve recently changed neurologists and I’m absolutely shocked and furious. One MRI and they found a chiari malformation that’s been causing such severe health problems that not just me, but my *doctor*, was pretty sure it was MS. My quality of life is nearly nothing and has been worsening gradually since I was born. This makes a lot of sense since chiari is present at birth. This is where it gets messed up.  

My last neurologist, who I’d been seeing since I was roughly 13 and finally gave up on this year, has done a minimum of three MRIs on me. I know it’s at least that much, though I don’t remember if more were done through his office. As my migraines periodically worsened we checked repeatedly for tumors and every time they told me the MRI was completely normal, detected nothing. It’s tempting to write this off as the doctor not specifically looking for chiari and therefore missing it, which is already not great, but in 2019 my ex-boyfriend of all people became concerned I might have a chiari malformation and I took this concern to this doctor. He reminded me that I’d just had an MRI the previous year and that he could see that I didn’t have one. He told me that we could do it if it would make me feel better but it would be a waste of time and money. His tone heavily implied I was a hypochondriac and I decided not to do the MRI because of it.  

This alone is bad enough, but what made me give up on this neurologist this year was that I found out he was prescribing me both the autoinjector and syringe of my migraine medicine. Because of this they were able to charge me a fee to submit a prior authorization for the same medication every 3 months — every time one would be up they’d switch to that one. I had no idea and supposedly no one in their office caught it. For over a year.  

On top of that, when DHR required me to get a doctor’s signature for EBT saying I’m long term disabled and cannot work, this doctor’s nurse berated me in the middle of the waiting room. She went on about how migraines are not a disabling condition, how she has migraines and has to work so I can too. During this conversation she let slip that she’s filled out every school & legal form for all patients the entire time I’ve been going to this doctor. A few years ago I was denied for disability on the grounds that my migraines aren’t a primary headache disorder — I thought this was odd at first because I’ve never EVER been diagnosed with a primary disorder that’s causing the migraines. I now know that this same woman filled out the forms that went to my disability claim. Considering my doctor had readily available proof for the root of my problems but never diagnosed one and still led SSDI to believe there was one, this seems potentially malicious to me. However, I know this part is not concrete evidence. I do wonder if there’s any degree to which this could help my case.  

My sister insists I should sue for medical negligence and I can’t say I disagree. My life might have actually been ruined by this man’s practice. What should I expect? Do you have any advice? I also don’t know if there’s any record of me asking for a test for chiari, but there are definitely records of the MRIs they did on me previously. My first step, I’d assume, is a consult with a local lawyer. I’d still like to be prepared though, so hit me with your thoughts. Especially because a settlement would go a LONG way toward surgery to fix my chiari and finally give me a life.",0,1eyezvq,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eyezvq/advice_on_my_potential_medical_malpractice_case/,2,1724318952.0

Disability Insurance Payee,"My mother has been my Rep-Payee of my SSDI (for mental and some physical health detriments) since 2010, and as of last week (Pretty much mid August 2024) suddenly told me she dropped me as my rep-payee, probably because I accused her of misappropriating my money and having too many questions about undocumented money. There are a lot more issues going on between us beyond that, but further more, she is the landlord of the small house I am renting from her (she doesn't live in or come to this house ever, really) and I am now being forced to leave by the end of August (in nine days). Social Security told me yesterday that my money is frozen till I find a replacement Rep Payee. My Mother, who never really supported me or had my best interests at heart, knew my money would be frozen and she is kicking me out, leaving me homeless and penniless to save myself. I had procured a case manager, back in March of 2024, because my mother was just getting out of hand and I needed a way out of her clutches. He, unfortunately, is totally useless, gives me dead-lead resources, never visits me OR keeps suddenly rescheduling meet-ups and my life is/was getting worse. I have been trying to get help and advice from local non-emergency police, the court, Disability rights (which I just cant get a bloody hold of for months via emails and phone calls) and the abuse hotline (who the counselors just have me on infinite wait, after being transferred from the receptionists, and I give up after over 20 minutes of wasting my government phone minutes). The local church I go to didnt help me attain family counseling to assist me in forming a relationship with my mother, like Ive never had, and she purposely sabotaged it totally, regardless. Ultimately, I have been making hundreds of calls and getting circled around and having time wasted being transferred the same useless people. Despite trying to live a peaceful life, within my means, my mom's ASPD from past trauma is stating to elevate, I am repeatedly getting financially and emotionally abused by her, and I AM the one going homeless. Is there any possible help I can find, or do I just try to take my life, again? Also, since April 4th, I was placed on the ""Section 8 path program"" waiting list, set up by a female social worker, who is not my useless male social worker, to get affordable housing, to get out of my mom's rental property, anyways. Yet, come to think of it, how was I going to have control of my money if she wasn't going to do it anymore, like I had specified multiple times, and yesterday my local Social Security office denied my request to become my own rep payee. I hate generic spouted answers from agencies and people of authority that are false garbage! I cant get help from people who actually know what they are doing now-a-days. Do I seek litigation help? My mom is doing criminal acts and lying to the face of the government now, as in hurtful character defamation, and I dont know why or what her angle is, and she is believed at first glance, even behind my back and I am not allowed to explain myself or show my proof/receipts I have compiled to corroborate my story of her neglect and exploitation of me! I HAVE noticed that since I called her out on gaslighting my life, and in refusing to be her marionette any longer, she has become more disgusting towards me...This has to be totally illegal and I need to be able to exercise some protection as a Disabled individual here! Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.

"Interabled couple, my partner is a new wheelchair user and I am having some feelings","This is more of a rant/ramble than a question, but any point of view or advice is welcome. 

My partner and I have been together for over a year now and we are very happy together, overall the relationship is very healthy and stable. We are a physically interabled couple. We are both autistic and I am ADHD as well, but I don't feel comfortable calling myself disabled. My partner was not fully aware of their physical disability until about 6 months into our relationship. They have POTS and EDS. 

At first they were using a cane on bad chronic pain days, but the pain has got bad enough for them to get a wheelchair. We've talked about the idea of using a chair in the past, but we both thought it would be a few years out. I am (obviously) in full support of them using a chair, but I am still feeling a vague sense of anxiety around it. 

I know the way the general public treats wheelchair users and I'm worried that people will treat them as less since they are in a chair. People already stop us to ask unwanted questions about their service dog. We just want to go about our tasks without being harassed. And then there's accessibility issues going places, not every place has room for a chair or ramps. 

This is about my partner, not me. I am not the one going through chronic pain, I didn't have to make the hard decision to use a wheelchair. Yet, I still feel sad. 

It feels shitty to be feeling big feelings over this, when it is not about me. ",9,1exofjv,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1exofjv/interabled_couple_my_partner_is_a_new_wheelchair/,8,1724243591.0

Looking for jar/can/bottle opener recommendations,"Hi all, I'm looking for jar/can/bottle opener recommendations.

I have joints that dislocate and lock easily, and struggle to hold small objects. When opening jars recently I keep dislocating my wrists and fingers, and generally it is incredibly painful to try and open things. I have had several jars that I simply cannot open, and would like to open, stuck shut four about two weeks now.

This was not an issue until recently, because my roommate who opens things for me has moved out. Didn't know how blessed I was with that act of kindness until now.

Does anyone have recommendation for openers that are a little more bulky (to hold onto) but still open things with minimal effort?

Looking for a piece of writing about disability and partnerships.,"A while back, don't know how long, I came across a very emotional piece of writing. From what I recall, its someone wondering if their partner would still stay or put up with the limitations and worsening conditions. Asking if they were unable to tale care of themselves, would they be willing or want to take care of them still? It was kind of in that line of thinking of being disabled, potentially getting worse and wondering if your healthy partner will be able to or willing or wanting to still be there for you.

How to help an overlooked disabled adult ,"There is a non verbal man where I live. He points, waves and makes gestures. He's completely mute / cannot speak. People overlook him and say things like ""oh he's crazy"" ""he's not right in the head"" ect. At the shop, when he makes a motion that he's thirsty and gives money, people say ""Give him whatever juice it's not like it matters.""

For context I'm in the Caribbean and we are behind 30 years when it comes to disabilities ect.

It's sad that he never even got a tablet to press the buttons and it speaks... 

I was thinking I could make him one of those communicating boards and print it out? Things like yes / no / I want .. ect . I'm 90% sure he was never taught to read so maybe a chart with only pictures.

My doctor seems less concerned about my test results than he should be (update),"A couple days ago I made a post here about my doctor’s response to some blood work I got. In the original post you can see all the specifics of my test results. With this information I have subclinical hypothyroidism. When I did my own research through accredited journals or sites like Harvard’s medical publications I saw a list of symptoms that match up a lot with my issues. Initially my doctor said no medication and just to monitor my levels. After seeing your responses to my post I pushed back a bit and asked about the medication levothyroxine as well as a referral to an endocrinologist.

I finally got a response today and to summarize he told me that 
1) “Thyroid disease generally has very nonspecific symptoms” 
2) We should wait until my “free T4 numbers are abnormal before initiating treatment” 
3) He confirmed I have subclinical hypothyroidism but that it is “usually is not treated with levothyroxine.”

I’m a little confused because whenever I did research on subclinical hypothyroidism it came with a list of symptoms that overlap with mine pretty consistently. I was also under the impression that subclinical hypothyroidism was high TSH (which I have) alongside a normal T4 level (which I also have) so I’m not sure why it wouldn’t be treated until my T4 levels were also abnormal. Another thing I’m confused about is that it wouldn’t be treated with levothyroxine since every time I look up treatment options that seems like the most frequently used medication…

I’d love the input of other on here with subclinical hypothyroidism on what treatments they have taken and if they had to wait until their T4 levels changed. And thank you to everyone who suggested I advocate for myself about this because my doctor has agreed to refer me to an endocrinologist which makes me really excited!",26,1exgdjc,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1exgdjc/my_doctor_seems_less_concerned_about_my_test/,32,1724213718.0
Hidden physical disability and making it obvious,"Hi

I have a kaput ankle and it is braced, strapped, wrapped within an inch of its life just so i can walk. However, I'm 6ft tall and no one is looking at my ankle or the slow disjointed way I walk and I'm finding everyone under the sun, including obviously disabled people, are getting angsty and hostile with me. I obviously look like a dawdling tourist or something.

How do I make it obvious to people I'm actually struggling to walk without wearing a massive banner stating the obvious?

Should I use a crutch even though I dont need and it would actually aggravate my other joints (I have ehlers danlos and crutches cause me wrist problems).

Or is there some other mobility aid that is noticeable which I could appropriate when I'm trying to navigate the hostile mobile world.

The Harsh Reality of Unemployment for People with Disabilities: How Do We Stop Feeling Like a Burden?,"I’m struggling with something that I think a lot of people with disabilities might relate to. Finding a job is hard enough in today’s economy, but when you have a disability, it feels almost impossible. There’s this constant pressure to contribute, to not feel like a burden to your family, but how do you do that when the job market is already tough for everyone, let alone for someone like me?

I’ve applied to countless jobs, tailored my resume, and tried to highlight my skills, but it often feels like my disability is the first thing employers see. And then there’s the emotional toll – this feeling of not pulling your weight, of being more of a financial strain than a support. It’s exhausting.

I’m curious – for those of you who are also navigating unemployment or underemployment with a disability, how are you coping? Have you found ways to break through the barriers? How do you deal with the feelings of guilt or frustration?

And for anyone who’s been able to find meaningful work, what advice do you have for the rest of us?

Is It Typical For Parents To Have Conversations About Their Child's Disability With The Child Themself?,"Not too long ago, I found out that this whole time I was diagnosed with Selective Mutism way back when I was 9. So naturally, I assumed that my mother purposefully hid my diagnosis from me but she claims that she didn't and that she told me some time after I got diagnosed and because I was young, I must've not remembered what she said. 

I asked how come I've never heard her, my brother, family members, therapist, etc, ever use the term before then in all these years? She admits that she and everyone else never actually said the term around me because ""everyone knew about it so saying the word didn't seem necessary"". Something along those lines, it was a very bizarre reasoning to me. And it turned out that my brother never knew I had SM either and the first time he heard the word is when he heard my mother and I talk about it a couple of months ago. 

She also claims that she told him when one day he asked her basically what was wrong with me and again said that because he was young, he didn't remember it. 

Is this normal and typically what parents do?? They tell the child and their siblings about the disability one time and after that, they just don't ever use the word again or have any in depth conversations about it because ""everyone now knows""? So if you don't remember, then sucks to be you? Like I never heard her say anything like ""Hey, have you ever told your friends about your SM so they would understand you better and know why you don't speak?"" or ""Hey son, I found this book and a video about SM that I think will help you out a little."" 

Conversations and discussions that I'm guessing are standard to have but they never happened because saying the word Selective Mutism just didn't seem necessary? Idk man, this situation seems shady to me. My diagnosis supposedly wasn't supposed to be this secret that I can't know about but at the same time for over a decade no one in our household never heard or used the name of my disability ONE time? I feel like you have to put in some kind of effort to do that as a parent, there is just no way it just never came up. I really don't know what to think. Maybe I'm in the wrong for thinking this way?

At least my brother also not knowing was validating.

Beyond frustrated!,"I am a power wheelchair user. I cannot ambulate at all. I got a new power wheelchair around Christmas of 2022.

Computer setup for bad back? ,"Hey, I'm not entirely sure how to ask this lol so bear with me. 

I have a horrible back. If it's flared up enough, I can't walk, sometimes even WITH my walker. Today, I just wanted to work on my game some more (I've been learning Godot!) but my back.. No matter how I sat in that chair, it hurt like HELL. 

Any chair stiffer than a recliner or a couch hurts me like no other. So, friends, I ask- do you know of any elusive computer chairs that don't suck, or desks that can be set up over a couch or reclining chair (but then don't essentially trap you in it)? 

For context, I have a laptop, but it's really heavy and thick gaming one so I typically just keep it at a desk. Plus I have a second monitor that's plugged up to it 24/7. So ideally, an actual desk is best, though i suppose I could begrudgingly give up the second monitor if it means being in less constant pain when I'm at the desk... 

Any suggestions? Thank you in advance! ",2,1exgtg1,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1exgtg1/computer_setup_for_bad_back/,5,1724215235.0
This is not the suffering Olympics,"I don’t care that “other people have it worse” I don’t care that you have other patients who are worse off than I am. It’s not your job to tell me that other people have it worse, when I could automatically earn the gold medal for “youngest patient on the neuro floor” it’s lonely, and terrible. Being nineteen years old on a neurological critical care floor is awful and scary especially when most other patients are half a century older than you, and you’re not allowed to leave your room. 

How can you look at a patient’s chart and say “oh yeah! Two hemorrhagic strokes/IVH right after birth resulting in cerebral palsy, and this kid just had surgery to put in a baclofen pump, my other patients have it worse than this kid!” No one should have to experience being nineteen in the neuro unit. My night shift nurse was appalled when I told her about my day shift nurse. It didn’t help that my mom was parroting her usual “it could be worse.” I’m guilty of sometimes thinking that same way of “some people have it worse” when people complain about minor issues. But to actually say that to a patient as a nurse is literally insane.",212,1ewk8je,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ewk8je/this_is_not_the_suffering_olympics/,36,1724120477.0

I 'advocated' and made my case manager cry... Now I feel like shit.,"For some background, in March I was hospitalized in an absolute hellish ltac because my boyfriend had to learn to care for me, and we were promised additionally hours in a max of 2 weeks from discharge.

So my boyfriend became my full time caregiver. He CHOSE it. However, we were told we'd have more help. I'm more than a full time job.

My case worker is new and submitted the paperwork wrong, 5 times. 

I kept calling for updates and finally he stopped answering. 

Then Blayze got sick. Not a little. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance and my mom took over. 

Honestly I believe it was complete and utter burnout.

I called my case manager and as politely as possible, chewed him out.

He called me back after 30 minutes and his voice was straining, and so I ask him if he's ok, and he tells me he feels frustrated. I ask why and he says, I'm failing. I'm failing you and Blayze and I'm frustrated with myself and for you guys. He apologized profusely. For EVERYTHING. 

We came up with a game plan. He has sent the paperwork one last time, and if it fails he'll go to his supervisor. 

I want to advocate, but I never want to make someone cry or feel like a failure. But I'm also so grateful he apologized and is finally working with me. And without a doubt, he has messed up. 

P.s. YES he is burnt out. We never planned THIS to happen and it's not our fault. Our relationship remains strong.",325,1ewd1jp,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ewd1jp/i_advocated_and_made_my_case_manager_cry_now_i/,87,1724101250.0
Who would I contact at school if my school refused me accomodations/discriminated against me?,"So I'm a paraplegic, T1 incomplete, cannot walk at all. I'm currently in college and I have accommodations in place to help me. I use a wheelchair and it's a normal lightweight custom wheelchair, it's not one of those fancy ones that have the capability of standing or anything.

I started class last week. There was an assignment which required the use of paper towels (there's a paper towel dispenser in the room) but I couldn't reach it. I asked for the teacher if she could help or if anyone else could assist me and she said no. Then she proceeded to tell me I could continue without the paper towels but I got points taken off for not having it. This wasn't the only time she's done this though in the one week since school's started. She's told us to grab things before which were placed on a high shelf and wouldn't help me, and I instead had to get a student to help me but I was told other students wouldn't always be available to help and I was like... okay? 

I've talked to another staff member about this but she basically told me to drop out. She gave the reasoning that ""not all accommodations are possible"" instead of listening to me and told me ""well we could give blind people all the accommodations in the world and they still wouldn't be able to drive a car so accommodations have limitations"" but I don't think that simply asking for someone to grab paper towels for me is such a big deal?

Anyways I contacted disability services who told me to call the Title IX coordinator but she told me that she wasn't the right person to contact. 

Who would I contact about this? Do you guys have any ideas? Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask

Edit: I just wanted to add that it's not just her being unhelpful. She takes points off of multiple of my assignments already for things like not being able to get materials. And when she was showing us the computer lab in the building where we can take the tests we have online, I couldn't get there when she was showing the class because the elevators were down at the moment for whatever reason and she didn't take me and she even called me out for it (to be specific she said ""I don't give paper tests so you'll have to find some way to get yourself to the lab).

a rant from a throwaway,"26m

I don't know what to say.

An unfortunate truth, I don't belong in this world.

I successfully hid my mental disabilities to my own detriment.

I realized I couldn't continue working about a year ago. I was in a downward spiral for a very long time.

Withdrew all of my money and decided I would just survive until it ran out.

I've overstayed my welcome.

My debt is astronomical now.

I found a lump on my testicle a few weeks ago, the cherry on top.

No friends or family to rely on.

No insurance. Haven't seen a doctor in years.

Mental health getting worse. Sleeping around eighteen hours a day.

I live in the shadows of society.

I'm envious of people who have the bare minimum. I've grown to hate the people who have it all.

The world is dystopian and cruel.

I have no will to continue.

No motivation to seek help.

I compare my struggle to others and realize I don't deserve it anyways.

I was generous when I had nothing. I wouldn't be in the position I'm in now if I hadn't been.

You all have it rough.

This isn't a cry for help. This is a warning.

My only regret, don't be like me. Be selfish.

I don't have money for diagnosis or doctor appointments. I don't have money for therapy or treatments. Even if i did, I certainly don't have the energy or time to get all of those things.

Opinion on disability ‘miscalculation’,"Just wanted some feedback on this situation. I’ve been receiving disability insurance for five years. I was fully approved for social security last year (which paid back). 

Two months ago disability came after me wanting a different evaluation (despite the government and a dozen doctors previously verifying my health). I never received a response back, but yesterday they reached out about a payment miscalculation on their part. For five years, they’ve been paying me 42 dollars too much. They now want me to pay them back either in full, chunks or siphoning it. Ironically they go quiet for months at a time, but this happens and they’ve called me several times a day. 

The whole situation feels odd to me and I’d love some feedback.

Idk if I should appeal or not…,"After waiting 19 months, I’ve been denied. My lawyer never seemed very on the ball(to me anyways) and idk if I should wait for them to call me about this or if I should call them. 


Honestly I don’t even know if I’m going to appeal. This is my second denial (first with a lawyer) and I’m tired of all of it. Of the false hope and lack of communication. My body hurts, it’s hard to do day to day things *sometimes* and I just feel like they look at my age and say “nope. Too young.” As if I ASKED for this shit to happen to me. But I know if I “suck it up” and get a job, my body & mind will deteriorate further/faster and it’ll be worse, but at least I won’t have the cloud of finances hovering over my head. Like yes, my husband makes enough for us to survive. But I don’t want to survive, I want to live. I want to feel like I am contributing to this house hold in some way that is actually worth something. 

I just don’t know if I should bother appealing or if I should just pretend I’m fine and get a job and let my body get worse to the point that maybe somebody in the damned disability office will believe me. ",69,1ewipj5,disability,https://i.redd.it/2gf0lw07ypjd1.jpeg,57,1724116046.0
Deaf or hard or hearing people,"I feel like the answer is an obvious don't do that, but I'm gonna ask because I'm curious and a little desperate.

So I do not have any hearing impairment. I want to make that clear. I do have a service dog for mobility reasons, and I also have autism which makes me sometimes go mute so I know a good chunk of asl and can have rough conversations.

I go to a cafe to work on my novel, quite often. About 5 times a week, I'm a professional writer, and that's where I do my best work. The staff know me and my dog and are great, they know my order if I go mute, I love them all!

The problem is I struggle to focus and especially, getting started on writing some days, and once I'm interrupted I have to start all over with trying to get refocused. I usually have about 4 people daily, walk up to my table to talk to me about my dog, and it's stupid conversation, or really personal uncomfortable stuff. I am usually fine with answering everything, or telling them it's not their business anywhere else but at the cafe its effecting my work and writing time, which is my income.

Other methods I've tried:

I've tried using wired earbuds so they see them and get the memo to f off, but I've had many times people will touch me and pull them out to talk. It's incredible rude and I hate being touched especially by strangers, but I live in a town with lots of old people and I'm in my very early 20s and only have hidden disabilities.

I also sit in the back corner away from people, trying to make it clear to leave me alone

I've also tried little signs and stickers telling people to leave me alone, or I'm busy, or even a sheet with the most asked questions and the answers and people just don't look.

Here's the question or the would I be the ass

Could I just pretend to not hear them?

Dorm Living Accommodations,"I recently moved into a college dorm for freshman year where I'm living with a roommate and using separate communal bathrooms. Everything is great except for the showers and restrooms. I am someone who needs a place to put my things (not on the floor, I am not putting my towel and clothes there) and a place to lean, but these stalls and showers have none. I've tried bringing in extra hooks that sit hanging over the stall door, but I still prefer having some kind of counter for product space and added support.

  
My options are to move to a single room with a private bathroom--which means moving buildings from where all my friends are, or stay where I am and forfeit the ease of basic hygiene/function. Usually I'd say that accommodations take precedence, but I think it's equally as important to maintain friendships and not isolate myself in freshman year of college.

  
Unfortunately the school sees my disability as more of a 'preference' than a need, so when I tried asking if there's an ADA restroom in my building they got really confused since I'm technically able to use the showers and facilities on my floor. Luckily, the student disability center is happy to make the switch, but there's no room for compromise. I really could use some advice on what to do. Should move buildings?

I was actually kinda hopeful, as this was a major hospital in my area that is well know for good quality care.  I've been suffering from chronic pain that occurs waist down, as well as in my shoulders and forearms.  I've also had muscle weakness and fatigue.  After a good 2 hours of answering lots of questions, all I was told is that my pain is mechanical, which just means that it results from movement.  They said that no scan or tests needed to be run, and that I just have to live with it, as I'm able to push through the pain (note: I have had very few tests actually run, only two panels of bloodwork.).  They didn't want to refer me anywhere else until I had done a good year of physio.

My mum is convinced that my weight is the cause of my constant pain,"So, I'll cut right to the chase. My mum is convinced, and lectures me frequently, that my weight is the cause of the constant joint and back pain I've been in for most of my teenage life. I'm 17 now, and I have hypermobility and scoliosis (though a friend of mine is convinced that I might have EDS, because I share almost all of my symptoms with her sister who has EDS, and have some symptoms/traits which aren't really found with hypermobility).

Obviously, my disabilties have been there my entire life, and as such, have caused me lifelong pain and problems. I struggled so much with writing as a child that it was the cause of me being heavily berated and punished by my primary school teachers, and my back pain alone has brought me to literal tears. 

Recently(as in since I was 13), my pain has been getting dramatically worse, and it's only escalating. The doctor I was seeing about my scoliosis said that thankfully, the curvature will not get any worse, but between the two appointments I had with him(a year apart), my shoulders noticeably misaligned, and my posture is pretty bad because of my scoliosis. I have only been to one appointment for my hypermobility, which was my diagnosis when i was 7, and since then I haven't seen any specialists and was not given physiotherapy or any advice on how to manage it. 

But as I said, my pain and discomfort levels have been steadily increasing, and from the start of this year, theyve taken a upwards nosedive. I'm always in some kind of pain, my back always hurts, and every joint in my legs is seeming to become more and more unstable. I had a bout not too long ago of my knees constantly buckling, causing me to fall once. I've also had to sit out of much more activities than I have in the past, purely because my body would not be able to manage it. An hour of non stop walking can cause me agony for the rest of the day. To go more into detail, my lower back hurts like crazy, every joint in my legs feels like their having a nail rammed into them, and my knees and hips constantly threaten to give out. Almost every day I'm brought to the brink of tears by my pain, and I have to fight the urge to simply collapse on the ground until it goes away. Painkillers don't touch it, warm baths and showers don't touch it, nothing I do seems to help. My joints are constantly groaning, clicking, and half-sliding out of place, and I have slight limp that gets worse when the pain does.

So, as I've mentioned, my mum thinks that it's entirely my weight that is the cause of this. Her reasoning is that I didn't have the pain when I was younger and thinner, but the thing is is that yes, I did, just in my arms more than my legs. I will give it to her that, yes, I am a bit overweight, but in no way obese. I don't participate in sport, nor am I a gym goer, but I do have a lot of walks, and I have been swimming for all of my life. I have no interest in sports like football or netball or anything, im much more of an arts person, but I still make sure that im not spending every moment of the day hunched over my work.

We clash a lot because of our differing opinions in my health. She doesn't want to accept the fact that im disabled, or that my disabilties affect my life. She thinks that obsessively watching my weight and diet will be the cure for my disabilties. While I get that my disabilties can be managed by things like that, I also know that weight doesn't really affect it as much as she thinks. I have a friend who also has Hypermobility, stick thin, and suffers more than I do. I'm also a tad weary to take diet and weight advice from my mum, as she used to, and in my opinion, still does have an eating disorder. 

I've tried to talk to her multiple times about my physical condition, but she always wrangles the conversation back to talking about her magical cure. I cant even express how much its affecting me without her somehow pushing the blame onto me, saying my laziness and weight is the only reason I have these problems, so I try to avoid talking to her about it. I have a physiotherapy session scheduled soon, but my mum is convinced that it won't do me any good, and that she doesn't know why I'm expecting them to be able to do anything for me, or magically make all of my pain go away. I don't think this, and I've never expressed this to anyone, I just think maybe getting at least a professional opinion would help. My mum was the one who begrudgingly set up the appointment, but she opted for a video call session rather than in person. She said it was because there was a longer wait time for the in-person one, but I knew this and had told her that I didn't mind waiting a few months if it meant I could see someone face to face. I know that she probably didn't mean it in a bad way, but I just have a feeling that they won't be able to properly help me over the phone. 

I guess im just asking for an opinion, because I don't really know what to believe. My friends think that I need medical Intervention, which is what I think, but there's a little voice in my head that thinks my mother might be right.",48,1ew1ist,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ew1ist/my_mum_is_convinced_that_my_weight_is_the_cause/,46,1724073360.0
Looking for advice ,I am a teenager young adult with severe mobility disabilities as well as severe issues with Gastrointestinal function. I have such severe fatigue and chronic pain that I end up sleeping most of the day because my pain medications make me tired. I am able to do some things that are like 3-4 hours each day. But I have to be able to stay in my wheelchair for that time. I’m interested in getting my first job. I really don’t care at all about what money I would make. I’m currently living at home with my parents and I’m struggling to complete ADLs and I am mostly stuck at home. I could work at some kind of minimum wage job like an art studio or a cashier in a small business. I’m not able to go for a long shift but I would definitely be able to do 3-4 hours a day a couple days a week. I’m really just trying to get something in my life that makes me feel like I’m doing something with my life not just being a sick person. Is this a type of job that actually exists? Would any small (as in size of the store) business actually hire me or would they pass me off? I’m looking to get a new community I enjoy being around. I’m interested in working at the party studio near me or in a small education and fun toys store. ,1,1ewrze2,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ewrze2/looking_for_advice/,1,1724149256.0

A ground floor apartment has changed my life (positive post),"I became a wheelchair user in February and lived in a duplex with stairs to the entrance and stairs to all the bedroom. For 6 months, I had to rely on my roommates carrying my chair down the front steps and basically carrying me and just left for doctor's appointments. I had to sleep on a mattress in our living room. Our lease ended and we were able to move to a ground floor apartment. 

What do you mean I'm able to leave my house on my own? What do you mean I'm able to sit outside when I need fresh air and watch the sunset and enjoy the fact that I didn't die in an ICU in February? What do you mean I'm able to take my dog on a walk?

The regaining of that independence and autonomy makes me want to f*cking bawl. We had this big rainstorm and I love the rain so much and I was able to watch it from our covered patio.

Job rights ,"TLDR; I’m basically being penalized for being sick and I dont know what my actual rights here are… 

I know this is really long but if you do have the time to read it I could really really use some advice/ help

So I started my job with the government a year ago next Monday and they have your first year as a “probationary period.” As soon as I got this job I communicated with my supervisors about my disabilities and the issues that come with them. I also immediately registered with the ADA. Anyway, I’ve been going THROUGH it health wise and have been coming in an hour or 2 late once ever 3-4 weeks. When I am at work I work SO hard like I do my work and several other peoples and they know that. I had my meeting today where they told me whether they were going to hire me full time or not once my year is over…. and they said they weren’t going to hire me full time because of my attendance issues. Mind you I’m using my earned sick leave time for any time I’m missing at work. We get 4 hours every 2 weeks so it’s literally not even possible for me to be taking off that much. They hired me in another probationary period because my bosses and team “went to bat really hard” for me and executive office wasn’t going to hire me back but my team fought for me. I’m absolutely FLOORED. This means all the rules that come with a probationary period as well as a lower pay. 

My supervisor sucks and honestly has been targeting me since I started my job (my coworkers agree). I dont know what my rights are here because I was 23 when I started this job and this is my first real job and I feel like I’m being punished for being sick which is something I cant control. I’ve been communicating with my supervisors this whole time about my conditions and at this meeting my supervisor said to HR I dont communicate. I’m collecting all of the emails and texts because I have communicated every step of the way- basically she tells me to do things and I do them and then she tells HR I dont. I literally asked her in front of everyone what she’s wants me to be doing because I’m already doing it. It’s just such an environment where these people allow eachother to treat others poorly because they’re friends and have been working together for 20 years. Everything was so fucked up and I was absolutely stunned 99% of the conversation and I started crying because I was so confused and angry. They’re not hiring me back as a full employee (and honestly I’m going to tell them I dont want to work for them at all if they treat people this way) but I was just wondering what I can do in this situation? 

My supervisor has apparently targeted people in the past and the specific unit I work in can’t keep anyone. I dont want her to do this to anyone again and I want her to know that this was disrespectful and discriminatory. I’m going to as for a meeting with  the HR person that was in the meeting and also one who wasn’t so we can have a 3rd opinion. I also want to address each thing about my attendance without my supervisor there so they can get the real story and I’m going to bring them proof that I’m communicating. They said that it’s because i let her know first thing in the morning if I’m not coming in and that i should be giving her notice as soon as I  know I’m not feeling well… one of my conditions is POTS so I’ll go to bed fine and then wake up and faint getting out of bed. I let her know immediately and have had several meetings with her explaining that these episodes aren’t something i can anticipate and these are a life long conditions (I have a lot more than just POTS). Mind you one time I tried to explain things to her she told me she didn’t want to know details because it “crossed a line” so which is it???? The attorneys I work for love me and are always telling everyone how amazing my work is and how the unit couldn’t function without me. I love them and love working for/with them but the people in charge of the support staff are treating me like I take every other day off and don’t do shit when I’m there. I dont know what to do but I feel like this is not okay. ",3,1ewl8nv,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ewl8nv/job_rights/,7,1724123391.0

How do you guys accept being stuck in a crappy situation?! ,"UGHHHHH I want to work so desperately so I can move out and not be treated like crap for the rest of my life but no one will hire me for a remote job. I'm working with the states vocational rehab center and they've basically told me there's no hope of finding a remote position these days. I started applying for ssi (my second time) in January but my lawyer couldn't get things together and my application didn't get processed until this month. I'm just so freaking sick of this. My sister and her husband recently gave me the option to move in with them (that comes with a laundry list of ""rules"") and it makes me sick to think about how much I'll be burdening their lives and complicating their relationship etc. I will have to do chores for allowance and I have zero idea if that'll even come close to covering my monthly costs. I have two pets and am 31 years old and me, my pets, and all of my belongings will have to fit in one tiny bedroom in their house. I just don't even know what to do anymore. Oh and if I move in with them my lawyer said my chances at winning my ssi case will be drastically lower because I'll be in the same court I was at for my previous denial. I know it's better for everyone else if I stay with my partner and better for me in a lot of ways but he treats me so terribly and I just can't handle the idea that I'm going to be stuck in this crap situation for the rest of my crappy life just because no one will even give me a chance to work for them.

How do you deal with not being able to do the career you want?,"I want to be a paramedic, but because I have epilepsy I can’t do it, even if my seizures are controlled it apparently doesn’t matter until I’m at least 5+ years seizure free, I only got diagnosed 10 months ago.

Cane - how to keep track of a cane? ,"Good afternoon. 

I can't find anything that fits, so I'm asking for help.  

My Mom has neuropathy in her feet and legs, and a couple of other medical problems. She can walk on her own, and occasionally uses a walker. 

She prefers her cane, which is a basic aluminum one. Unfortunately, she can forget where she left it, and it's a dark color, which can make it hard to find. 

I want to have a tracker on it, so we can find it quickly.  Unfortunately, I haven't found anything ideal.  The strap is long gone. I tried an Orbit stickon some years back, and that was a fiasco. It didn't stick, and finally disappeared - I think it had help coming off, but she swore it didn't.

If we use something like a keychain to attach it, won't that just slide down and then interfere with her walking? 

Suggestions and/or help, please?  

Thank you,
Theresa

Employee with Muscular Dystrophy ,"Backstory: I have Muscular Dystrophy (diagnosed at age 2, way back in the 1990s). I've used a wheelchair full time since I was 11, and saved during college to buy an accessible vehicle. I've worked full time since graduating and getting this van, have been married, had a baby, got divorced, and now have worked at my local government providing solely for my child, who's now 5. Just got an additional fact, my child was also diagnosed at age 2 with MD. I rent an apartment.

We received no financial assistance because we do not qualify. I don't make tons of money and am struggling but still make too much. The van is totally unreliable and a dealership has literally done everything free of charge because they took pity on the situation. But a different reliable vehicle is needed, which is around $60k avg.

My body has grown increasingly weaker the past couple years and I can barely dress myself. When I do I feel the need for a 10 hour nap. I haven't done any steps to check for Disability income other than the basic search on the SSA site. 

I know MD is one of those areas where you could easily qualify, but I'm not sure about me currently working. Is there a certain time I HAVE to be unemployed for in order to apply? Is it possible to have a small unemployment period, or does it have to be for 1+ years?",2,1ewiuur,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ewiuur/employee_with_muscular_dystrophy/,1,1724116461.0
The most difficult time of my life is now...,"TLDR: (I'm sorry so long, I'm struggling)

I'm a 44 y/o m, I've struggled with Bipolar Schizoaffective disorder, with acute anxiety, for 12 years (on paper), I'm sure a lot longer. I spent my adult life always living with someone, usually a girlfriend, I was married once. I've been on my own for last 2 years, maintaining everything by myself. 
I live in the city in a small apartment with my cat.

These last 3 months have been probably the most difficult of my life. A whirlwind of negative and anxiety ridden events out of my control have emotionally impacted me one right after another. I feel like it doesn't stop. There's just so much it can't all be said here, would be longer than it already will be. But it started with my last job, I was a clinician at a methadone clinic. Why I decided to take that job, that's just beyond me.
The weeks leading up to my start date, let's just say I was unaware and oblivious as to what was happening to me and my mind. 
I take medication and usually see a therapist if it's affordable or I have insurance, and I've had a very few full-on episodes of my disorders, yet each time it happens, it's always worse than the one before. 
I didn't realize it but my symptoms were beginning to rise to the surface once again as I took on that job. I've been doing clinical work for 7 years. However, I have a long history of being unable to keep a job for an extended time. I hop from job to job, can never be consistent or fully stable. 
I was in permanent SSDI disability from 2013 to 2016. And then when I got sober and stable, I felt I could return to the workforce. I busted my ass for 2 years to attain my Masters Degree in Addiction Psychology. I became a licensed addiction clinician. I think I will always struggle with my own sobriety. And maybe it sounds crazy, but I am very good at talking to and listening to people, hearing their struggles, offering skills for them to learn that I know are effective and that have helped me. 
If you see my profile picture, maybe you'll get the picture more. I've always been one to set myself on the line to help another who needs it, yet struggle to maintain myself.

At work, I was beginning to lose control of some of my behaviors and my very unconventional thoughts were beginning to race slowly out of control. Within the first week of work, I was looking for holes, weaknesses, in the job itself. I guess that's what I tend to do. I probably look for reasons why I shouldn't be there. But after 1 week, I got impulsive and inappropriately raised my issues about the lack of training and structure there to my boss in a long text message.

It was then, when he sat me down in his office, that I briefly divulged to him that I have a mental illness. A disability. From that moment on, I was singled out from the rest, treated opposite of everyone else by the 2 lead supervisors. From berating and intimidating speeches, to embarrassing and hurtful emails, to what seemed like a special set of rules for me to follow that didn't apply to anyone else. Very quickly, I began to spin, and I was oblivious. 

As the days went by, I started dreading the 40 minute drive, my anger rose to the surface and began to take ahold of my moods. My girlfriend at the time eventually told me how very negative I was behaving. I look back she was right. I hated everything and every person. Each day at work brought more anxiety, insecurity, and fear. I had consistent and daily suicidal and homicidal thoughts and feelings.

The constant berating speech my bosses used around me, the unfair way in which they were treating me, left me with a number of strong and destructive feelings. I was very angry. I told myself I needed a gun everyday. I really felt horrible inside, consumed with anger and hate and being at work around them only added fuel to that fire. 

It became clear in my brain that I was being discriminated against by these people. They knew I had a mental health disability and it hurts me to think that the things they did to me, were intentional. 
Eventually I called out of work the last 3 days in a week in June. I had had it, I couldn't stand to be around them any longer, i was spinning,so I took a leave of absence. I thought they would have just fired me. 

I filed for short term disability. Kept up with their documentation requests and had doctor visits. The weeks started going by, and I wasn't getting approved. I fought with them almost everyday and it seemed as though they always needed more information. My poor doctor, he has been throttled with medical forms to submit. In the end, they actually denied me, stating I had a pre existing condition that disqualified me. The denial  letter stated ""a reasonable and prudent person would have sought treatment in that situation.""  
Well, I'm not always reasonable or prudent, I am different than most, I had an episode and i mossed my initial doctors appt, i was exhausted from no sleep. My employers paid my last check and rejected the earned time I had submitted for the hours I missed. That pissed me off too. I hate these people with a very real passion. 

I also wasn't taking care of myself, I drank off an on. My girlfriend decided to break up with me suddenly and I did not cope well at all. Not one bit. 

I was so hurt and miserable I wished everyday that I was dead. 
All those weeks with no income. I was beginning to struggle to maintain my house and bills etc. One day they finally just terminated me, they said I had made a threat against an employee there. But I haven't spoken to anyone there since my last day worked. I'm telling you, these people are so cruel, and they make up their own stories to save their ass. The truth is, they didn't fire me for so long because it would have been wrongful termination for a person with a disability, and I just know that in my gut. So they made up a story. 

Since then, I've been consistently hacked, my phone and laptop, my TV and even my car. It's been going on for a while and I've concluded that someone is either obsessed with me, or they're stalking me and trying to terrorize me. So I disconnected my home internet device, just use the free network in my building. I've reset my phone twice. 

It was uncomfortable at first, But I've stopped giving a shit. If they are really watching me through my devices, then i must be quite an interesting person. And somebody smashed into my parked car and tore the left back end right off. Some random person from FB marketplace who showed interst in an item i was selling, well, i told him i had sold it to someone for a better offer. The next morning he proceeded to harass me via Messenger, saying thay i stole the item i sold out of his truck, and that i stole all his ""equipment"" from the truck too. I was in shock, baffled. Never met the guy, and was a big mystery to me. 
He also seemed to know where I had worked recently, knew about my addiction issues, said he knew my family and where I lived. I called the police and shared with them..
I also responded because I tend to have a big mouth and I've become fearless in the recent month. So I said, if you know where I live then come knock on my door and stop being afraid.

I've been in awe, it's as if the universe hates me. It doesn't stop. But now, I'm dead broke, I can't work, but I don't have a choice so I have to work even when I cant.
I've turned to a criminal lifestyle to make the ends meet. From selling drugs for someone, to a form of check fraud, I feel it's necessary to keep me afloat for now. I don't know what else to do. 

But I'm talking to a lawyer. 
I have nothing to lose anymore, so I'll ride that wagon to the bitter end til I get something back. I don't care, I am not afraid anymore.
I will do anything to survive, and in a world where people abuse me and take from me.

Does anyone have similar experience or advice for what I can do?  I am unsure about working and MetLife told me not to work while I am appealing the disability payments that are due to me. 

My landlord is a very kind man, and he has been generous with me. I will talk to him, but I hate not being able to pay him. I gave him.half of my expensive rent so far, all money earned by illegal means.I can't find an agency in New Hampshire that would assist with my rent unless I get an official eviction notice. 

Any thoughts or advice or anything really is welcome, I appreciate you if you took the time to read this....

My Siblings Say I'm Lazy and Don't Put in Enough Effort,"1st time poster here 34M from Ontario Canada, I've been disabled for the past 4 years due to ICU Polyneuropathy from a bout with Covid(Covid based Pneumonia leading to Multi Organ Failure)(was in a medically induced coma for 2 months). I have not fully recovered and knowing the condition I have, being 4 years out, I never will and I've come to peace with that, and mostly understand my limitations. Without going to heavy into details, I have no college degree and no certifications as I went to work right out of college to support the family, so all I have is work experience some of that being a union rep if that counts for something. My siblings think I don't do enough currently to help the family, as they both have dreams of buying a house and going to Western Canada to do it, and my not working wont be enough to support our mother once they are both gone (younger brother moved there 2 months ago and my sister who has 3 kids moved back in so she could save to move there in a year. They gave my mother and I an ultimatum move there too, or be left here alone and try to make ends meet when they are gone. I want to work, but I have no stamina, need walker/cane to get around, my feet in certain areas feel nothing not even pain(had venous ulcers that only recently healed cause of this), have severe sleep apnea( iirc my AHI was 120), im still weak for someone my age the list goes on. I feel like im making excuses, but Im not sure im being gas lit or lazy. I cried bitterly after a call with my brother when he told me that 4 years ago when I was in ICU and he saw me, what he meant when he said Its time to look after myself, was not that I should focus on healing and getting well, he said it cause he wanted me to get back in to work asap and take some classes get a 2nd job so we can start making some money to make ""moves"". This didn't feel any better after my sister called be big fat and useless and disabled. I genuinely felt like it would have been better I died from Covid they'd have at least gotten some insurance from me, what hurt the most is when my brother said he forced himself to move earlier than he wanted to cause of my condition, he coulndt take coming home from work knowing I just sit at home all day. Im currently on ODSP and every doctor I've been to says I should just focus on recovery, but I know there are those who work while disabled so Im not sure if its me my doctors of them.

Using ABLE account to pay off credit card,"My family and I have been working on another room in the house so I can move into a better room that's more accessible for me, and we've finally gotten to the point where I can start buying new furniture for it.

What I HATE most about these people is that they think they're doing you a favor and act like you're an inanimate object like a piece of furniture. 

How would they like it if someone did it to them? And when you resist, get mad, and communicate which they clearly feel like they're too good to do, they act like we're that bad guy. They act like we don't know what's best for ourselves and don't deserve the dignity of expressing how best to help us. 

I once saw a blind woman at a networking event for blind and visually-impaired fresh grads, with her boyfriend. We were all going somewhere and instead of telling her what was going on and getting her consent as I've described, he just yanks her across causing her to roll her ankle on her heels and spill her drink. And the idiot goes, ""Oh whoops, be careful. We're going to the auditorium now."" I walked up and tried to tell him that wasn't okay because she was clearly too shocked to say something. 

And this idiot starts trying to rationalize what he did, up until her father came and controlled the situation. I texted her later that evening on social media and she told me her boyfriend apologized. 

I hope she's okay and that guy learned better (I'm doubtful because that took a lot of audacity and ignorance to do). But this issue is one of the many aspects of ableism that I hate having to deal with. 

The worst part of being disabled to me is not just the disability - it's the removal of our dignity and autonomy by a society that sees us as less than human. Because we don't fit their standard of what a normal human being looks like, we are to be treated like broken objects as though we don't still have a place in this world.

Could I use the disabled toilets?,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit but I can't think of anywhere else to ask this)

Hey so, I have ADHD, and suspected autism, and sometimes I can't bare being inside closed tight spaces. I usually stay away from public toilets in those situations because I don't know if I am allowed to use the disabled toilets and I can't bring myself to go inside the small stalls. This only happens occasionally so can go inside normal stalls usually. 

I am looking for advise if it's okay to use them in those situations. Especially since I've heard stories of people getting harassed because they don't look ""disabled enough"" (stupid af I have to say). 

I feel pretty self conscious about myself because of my late diagnosis, I have been masking a long time and when I tell someone I have diagnosed ADHD, they sometimes don't believe me because I'm ""not hyperactive enough"" when I'm more towards the inattentive type (it's a mix of both but leaning towards inattentive).

This is a bit long so, sorry about that, I may have gotten off point a bit",0,1ewhf5h,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ewhf5h/could_i_use_the_disabled_toilets/,6,1724112514.0
I can’t afford anything and I have to work,"I live in ireland. If you’re eligible for disability allowance you get €232 ($256) a week, so €928 ($1024) per month.

I’ve applied for disability, they rejected it. I appealed, but that takes a minimum of 18 weeks for them to process it. I’ve been living on my fiancées disability allowance. €232 for 2 people doesn’t get you far at all, especially with medical costs.

So, I have to get a job. I can barely move some days, but I can’t afford this. I’ve had more responses from in person jobs than remote jobs, despite having a high paying remote job before my disability.

Need help finding a hobby for my gpa,"My grandpa is disabled. He's in his 80s and is a bit slower these days (still gets up at 5 am lol).

Toilet Seats,"Ok, so my condition involves both dystonia and spasticity, and I am ambulatory, for now. 

When I sit down on a toilet, the force is often not directed straight down. While I am *on* the toilet, my legs apply lateral force to the toilet seat that -- at the very least -- loosens the toilet bolts over time.

I've tried myriad different toilet seats, including ones with special non-slip bumpers, but it feels like it's always inevitable. I've thought about adding something sticky between the seat and bowl, at the bolt, but I then worry about bacteria.

"DNC to be the ""Most Accessible Convention""","The DNC has several stories running about it being the ""most accessible convention ever"". I would like to draw attention to the *obvious* need to expand and update what accessibility has been like to experience and where it has fallen short, and that is being generous. You have things like physical accessibility that address the needs of those with physical disabilities like major fixes to our cities infrastructure: ramps, working elevators in the L, etc. These are **VITAL** and 100% make the pleasures of Chicago accessible in that sense, *and* making these changes, especially as an addendum can be expensive. Where the DNC and organizers fell short is on is putting thought into **sensory accessibility** for those who are blind, deaf, and/or deal with other sensory processing challenges, and **cognitive accessibility** for those of us, like myself, who are autistic and may need information presented in a different format or more detailed than for the general public. Cognitive accessibility is often overlooked, can often have free/cheap solutions, provide clearer communication for everyone, and truly make events like the DNC closer to universal inclusivity. The DNC **needs to be honest** about this and make sure to have more forethought and prioritize the opinion of those *who rely on access* as opposed to those who design but don't utilize.

Not coming from a place of malice, but rather a place of disappointment? Long story short I signed up to be a volunteer in a clearance security role because of my military background. I was signed up for 2 shifts at MP and 2 at UC. I went through the process and sent some emails out regarding issues I was having navigating the process and some questions on various accommodations because I am autistic and keep kosher, etc. in addition to logistical things like my background check, perimeter because I bike, etc. I have sent literally numerous numerous emails to various people all within the DNC and no one is even responding with a status, I'm just being ignored. Asked questions in the zoom training - every question before and after mine were answered, or acknowledged, mine were ignored. Asked in the chat.. ignored. Sent an email after the zoom, which was answered by the head of accessibility apologizing for the experience I've had, asking me for clarification, and ensuring it's being taken seriously. I responded and have heard nothing, radio silence, since that day.",7,1evu6nb,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1evu6nb/dnc_to_be_the_most_accessible_convention/,2,1724045893.0
Do I have a case if I file a complaint?,"I have a depression and anxiety. I work at a corporate as a software engineer in NY, working remotely. I've been having a strained relationship with my manager, who failed to file for my promotion during the last cycle despite my bringing up every week for a month. 

After this happened, I felt he was upset at me because this did not look good on him in my organization. Also, I wonder if this negligence was because of his preference for certain personality even though I am objectively a high performer and he agrees. An example of his behaviors/words that make me this is, on our weekly one-on-one meeting once, he got upset and complained that, whenever he asks me how I'm doing, I never say ""great."" I guess I never feel great so I would just say ""ok."" 

There have been other occasions that I felt he treated me unfairly, although on those occasions the reason wasn't directly my mood or personality. I think he generally prefers more outgoing people who talk a lot and bubbly.

I have suicidal tendencies and self harm diagnosed  bpd anxiety eating disorder major depressive disorder and adhd. I’ve been diagnosed with adhd since I was a child and the rest I’ve always had but not diagnosed until I went to the local behavioral unit. I’ve been to my local behavioral unit two times because the first time they put “substance induced psychosis” which I was a drug addict yes however I wanted to kill myself because I was depressed over a relationship that tore me apart not because I was under psychosis anyways the next time I went the hospital put “Recurrent episode of depression” which it was and I wanted to kill myself once again. Then the third time I went to a behavioral unit in another state because of my ex it was a nightmare and they diagnosed me with ptsd too but there’s no recollection of that like what!!! I always searched for jobs nothing ever fit right my anxiety makes me stay inside all day sometimes I think I have schizophrenia my thoughts and voices of others never shut up people think I’m crazy and I am however these people will not admit that I am. What do I do? I’m a single mom I can’t even go outside without having a mental breakdown paranoia strikes me everywhere I go even in the house it’s bad. It feels like my whole life is on some type of clock where it just keeps spinning and I never have enough time I never get things right I feel as if I have to save everyone even tho it has nothing to do with me I always feel and even if my life’s in shambles.

My previous work was within digital marketing, but I don't actually have qualifications in it, the world has moved on massively since I last worked in that sector and frankly the work involved too much social skills that I don't really have, and I don't have the social energy because of being Autistic.

while my grandma marked me down as having a disability for scoliosis i also have generalized anxiety, social anxiety and depression (all diagnosed and have been treated with therapy and medication, nothing was helpful.) all of these also limit my ability to do everyday things as well, if not more than my scoliosis did.

"How do I come in terms with my disability, alone.","I'm 26, deaf/hard of hearing with a cochlear implant and a hearing aid and diagnosed with inattentive ADHD/Autism. I only had them for about than 16 months. Been deaf on one side my whole life and my other side bailed on me last year (sudden hearing loss). Probably being single sided deaf made me grow up like this, indoorsy introvert who is not sociable at all awkward around people and ""weak"" personality (probably as a result).

For the past year with the cochlear ear being a struggle for me, and frankly the hearing aid is not anything like the natural hearing. That in addition to me traveling abroad to study has made me miserable. Also in the same year I was diagnosed with ADHD because I noticed I was going into small depression episodes every now and then mainly it was me being sad when I think about my situation, can't talk smoothly with anyone without asking to repeat themselves, can't stand my cochlear and the noises I hear all the time and the loneliness I experience in this foreign country, where I'm also having trouble to make friends, I was never able to, it's always me being adopted by one or two people and be included in their circles.

  
Almost all the time I feel sad, one time I legit was laying on my bed for 3 days because I watched a video of someone complaining about having to charge their watch every day; mind you, I charge MY 'EARS' twice everyday, and I don't even have the luxury to forget.

Sorry if my post is long ,"I AM 22 BUT have developmental and intellectual disabilities to the point where I have the mind of a child. I can definitely be taken advantage of, and HAVE been manipulated, specifically my dad, it’s really scary. I’m deemed in need of high support, I can’t get a job, I don’t really have the capability to make choices for myself, I’m basically a kid. How I view the modern world is how a child would, I cant grasp super complicated subjects, i can’t cook, I can’t clean, on top of a whole other bunch of stuff that non disabled people take for granted, I like cartoons, I have meltdowns, I like Lego, toys, comic books, sweets (although nowadays watching cartoons are becoming less and less of a niche I've noticed) I live with my mother who i'd be lost without, im asexual so i don't even WANT to partake in those types of acts with anyone. However mind you, little kids can get crushes too, their just different from adult or even teenage crushes, my first crush was a girl I knew on my street when I was 8, the reason I liked her was because we both liked Lego. It certainly wasn’t sexual or anything like that, it was just a crush I didn’t understand. Even now when I have a crush on someone it’s always in a very non sexual childlike way, I just wanna play with Lego and watch movies and be their for each other. I hate that autism to some people is just “special interest hehe quirky” when their exists autistic people who’s life are ACTUALLY negatively affected by it. I've seen some kids learn something as a 12 year old but i cant even begin to comprehend it, My father alienated everyone in his family because of his hatred for his mother and he treated her in a disgusting manner, normalising the abuse super early on. Not to mention my Christian school would target me for bullying and targeted harassment because they knew I was too timid to tell giving me life long trauma, then had the gull to try and kick me out so they didn’t have to deal with me, which my father blamed me for, it took me years to realise everything that happened to me wasn't a normal thing that's just supposed to happen, Yeah I had my nana who always cared and mom who did her best with her crappy circumstances so I at least had some resemblance of a support system.

My father abused me my entire life, When time when i was a small child he punched his hand because I held onto his ankle, his kept punching it hard until I let go. When i was a toddler my dad was angry that my mum dared to go out for 1 night and leave him in charge, i was about 2 or 3 and i threw up all over myself, he refused to clean me out of spite.

On one occasion my dad strangled me when he was angry i was struggling to go a bike, afterwards he told me i wasn't his son, this really hurt because i was a really sensitive boy who often preferred my mum, which he was severely jealous of and try to cause a rift between us by spreading rumours that she wasn't taking care of me enough (my mum cleaned his little flat and gave him food because he couldn't do anything for himself)

One time my dad threw me into the street late at night and made me walk all the way home when I was about 8 or 9, no regard for my safety, the reason, we argued over a video game, yes I'm completely serious.

When i was even younger, his extended family would take family trips to a pebbled beach, and he walked me out to really deep water and left me their, on my own, neck deep in water keeping my balance, and walked away leaving me to walk back on my own terrified, i guess it was his idea of a joke but we never talked about it again.

Want to go even younger? when i was a FETUS my dad threw keys at my mother when she was pregnant with me, he insisted on getting both of their names on the house recently rented out, but thankfully my mother didn’t let him get his way on that, otherwise I’m certain he would’ve taken the family home and never let it go.

He wasn’t present at my autism diagnosis and argued when i was diagnosed.

He never helped out with Christmas presents, soon after I turned 18 I got so sick of his controlling attitude and cut him off, and recently he ignored my 21st birthday completely, he sent a card that was some online generic card with no thought or effort put into it, he didn’t care.

He went on to start a brand new family to replace me.",1,1evtpds,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1evtpds/sorry_if_my_post_is_long/,1,1724044031.0

The double standard of disability buses,"You'll see old people with disabled bus cards also using the public buses.

Yet, because I'm young and ""only"" mentally disabled, there's more pressure on me to only use the public buses. I have autism, severe OCD, and I have ADHD.

Apparently, I was only allowed to use this service for 1 year. I gotta go in for my assessment to be able to continue using this bus. If I was an old person, I wouldn't need to do this.

There are very few places I know how to get to on the public buses. Even then, the public buses trigger the dangerous urges/compulsions that come with having severe OCD. I seriously have a bad case of OCD induced by trauma. I even get episodes where my compulsions are worse. 

In general, I cannot handle being around big crowds of people because of how bad my case is. Plus, is it fair to expect a disabled person to use uncomfortable public bussing when it's not even totally safe? Accidents have happened with those buses and nobody has seatbelts.

Plus, I'm literally entering a work program for disabled people because regular jobs are difficult.",7,1evddnk,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1evddnk/the_double_standard_of_disability_buses/,6,1723998511.0
"Being ABLE to work hard is a privilege which the average (able-bodied) person isn't aware of    
","Before you come @ me about how it's a privilege to be able to not work (and I agree that there are certainly many circumstances where this is the case) please hear my perspective out...

I have been on both spectrums of being physically healthy/able-bodied, and being extremely chronically ill/disabled. When I was younger, I was an athlete (working out 5-6 days a week, 2-3hrs/day), able to do school full-time, and get straight-A's, and had multiple jobs. Basically, I was a type-A extremely hard-working, productive, and efficient member of society.

When I developed multiple chronic illnesses and health conditions in my early 20's, I went from being a superwoman who could do it all to basically completely bedridden. For a period of time my hands were disabled, I had 10/10 pain throughout my body 24/7, searing migraines, and I was physically incapable of walking. Needless to say, I could not work *any* type of job (blue-collared, white-collared, or otherwise) in that condition. At the worst of my health problems, it was literally impossible for me to work and I did end up living in my car for a period of time (in the beginning my family didn't believe my chronic illness was real and kicked me out because they thought I was mentally ill/lazy). Even jobs that could be done 100% online (which are already extremely limited for many career paths, particularly 10 years ago when I was in my 20's) were not possible for me due to the hand paralysis, migraines, and extreme neurological conditions (including light sensitivity to screens and very bad cognitive issues/brain fog).

After being told it's all in my head and that I'm just lazy/don't want to work (despite me being an extremely hard-working person for my entire life prior to my diagnosis) by virtually all of society, almost a decade later I finally have several diagnoses that validate my disabilities. I am also fortunate to have improved to some degree where I can still work (but not nearly to the extent that I used to be able to) with certain accommodations but I am still very limited by severe chronic pain and daily symptoms. I had to chance my entire career path and life around my disability, because the path I was taking was simply not accessible to me.

My chronic illness/disabilities essentially ruined my 20's, destroyed my bank account (medical bills leaving me with no savings, so I am nowhere near being able to save for things like a home or retirement). Coming from this perspective, it irks me sometimes when people deny that health/ability privilege is a real thing and act as if they do not have privilege to be able to work. I understand the plight of the lower-class/middle-class working person who needs to work very hard, sometimes in multiple jobs, to have a roof over their head and put food on the table. But for some people with severe disabilities/chronic illnesses, no matter how hard they want to or try, this is quite literally not possible or accessible. Many of those people end up losing everything and becoming homeless, then being further blamed and stigmatized for their situation.",221,1eusksw,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eusksw/being_able_to_work_hard_is_a_privilege_which_the/,30,1723930229.0

Entering the Work Force and Frustrated ,"I am graduating in December, but I only have one class this semester and the communication portion of my degree is finished, and career services at my university said I should try to start applying and getting interviews at least.

I agreed, I just lost my SSI benefits for saving student loan refunds to help pay for school, and I just want to be done and move on. I tried freelancing, but it’s not going well. 

It’s frustrating, because I am qualified. I have a portfolio with quality work from my time in communication and journalism classes, but it’s never enough. I feel like not matter how qualified I am, I’m just not getting a shot. 

I even had to change my major from journalism to communication, because journalism required an internship. Issue was, I couldn’t get one no matter how many I applied for. My advisor even said she had seen less qualified students have no issue getting an internship.

I’ve sat down with career services and worked with them to make a quality portfolio, resume, cover letter, everything. However, still, just not enough.

Stage IV cancer disability benefits,"I’m not sure if this belongs here or in a legal sub? But I’m in WA state. In 2013 I was diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer that metasized to my liver. I had many rounds of chemo, radiation, and surgeries that removed most of liver, feet of intestines, and my rectum. I had a colostomy bag for a year and was able to have it reversed. During that time we did not even consider disability benefits or anything besides fighting this and surviving and lived off of my wife’s very low income and student loans. We went into and remain to this day, very much in debt. 

My question is - looking back, am I able to now file for long term disability - I have been cleared of the cancer and “no evidence of disease” but the effects of the aforementioned treatment and surgery render me unable to hold a job. Without too much detail, for the first 6-7 years I could not leave the house for more than 30-60 minutes and tried as I might to hold a job, running to the bathroom in meetings or even as a salesman or bartender made it impossible to stay employed. Even now (in the past 2-3 years) I can leave for a few hours and have been better at controlling things, but not for long periods of time and sometimes get so constipated still my stomach becomes a beach ball and I’m doubled over in pain unable to move. 

I guess I wasn’t sure if there was a statute of limitations or how I even prove this or what can be done - it just crossed my mind as a family friend was told he had a disability and he’s trying to figure out the system now. My wife is still chugging along and supporting us without complaint for the last decade and I’m not sure if this would help us not live paycheck to paycheck (and I’m almost 60 so the other fear unlocked is she will never be able to retire since I’ll never be able to contribute financially, never mind save for retirement). And for the record I keep trying to get a job but if there are days on end with me running to the bathroom every 3-5 minutes, it just doesn’t last. and the feeling of my body failing me and me failing my wife just breaks my heart.

inaccessibility is a wild thing,"Something I've noticed about my city... and island in general, is that it's inaccessible as fuck. Like, so inaccessible even non-disabled people struggle to walk around💀
I live on this small rock in the southeast of Madagascar. We're pretty damn poor over there, and the terrain isn't exactly easy to navigate if there isn't a huge work of leveling it up done which is expensive and harmful to nature- sidewalks are narrow and broken, roads are full of potholes in most parts, and the very large majority of the cities are built on hills and steep terrain. It's mind-boggling, I'm telling you. If you don't have a motorised wheelchair, I sure as hell hope you don't skip arm day and abs day, because jesus you're gonna be struggling. And if you got crutches or a cane... I pray for you too. I got a cane to walk sometimes and it does very little when it comes to hills and broken up sidewalks.

Working and need to know rights ,"I’m working.  I am disabled.  I push myself to work.  I love the work I do.  Unfortunately like many of you I have dr appts frequently.  This November will be 2 years at my job.  In April I was hospitalized.   A couple of weeks later my husband was.  He isn’t disabled it just happened to be near when I had been.  I had not disclosed and I do have an invisible disability.  Two weeks after my husband’s hospitalization the division CEO and my supervisor called me via video to let me know that 3 out of the last 12 pay periods were under 80 hours.  Our handbook makes no mention of this being a problem.  She says because of this I would be considered part time.  However, there are no part time positions.  This is when I disclosed.  I said I’m always going to have Dr appts and I had not been hospitalized for years.  She said I would have to use intermittent FMLA for my Dr appts.  To back up a little - before this I would get in trouble for working too late. I normally had Dr appointments but would more than make up my time. I ran out of PTO at this time also. After talking to HR I was told not to worry about it. But I did have to have Dr excuses.  Only me, no one else in our division does.  A couple of weeks later I had my one on one with my COO and my supervisor. This was of course brought up. I explained I did not have to use FMLA but would use ADA leave.The next week I found out that I had to have wrist surgery. I was going to only take 1 week off but since they pushed about FMLA I filed and my surgeon said 8-12 weeks off. I wound up taking 8. During this time I was told our division was changed to 4 - 10'S and I was given Fridays off we were encouraged to make dr appointments on our off day. Unfortunately many of my drs do not see patients on Friday. First week back I had an appointment on Thursday. On Wednesday I worked thru lunch because I don't have PTO. My COO calls me on Thursday AM to tell me I can't work thru lunch.Because that is no longer allowed.  He asked me to manipulate my time to show a lunch and then I could just make up time on Friday. He also said I have to have 40 hours even though I don't have PTO, on Friday I made up my time plus 1 hour.in manipulating my time I forgot to account for that hour and lost one hour of OT. The next week I had an appointment on Monday. I was out of office for 3 hours. I try to stay late to make up time but my supervisor calls to tell me I have to go home. I had to have 40 hours.  I explained i had no PTO and I had to stay late to get the required 40. Was told no, have to go home. I did stay 30 min over. I took short lunches also. By the end of the week I only owed half an hour. Popped in on Friday and worked it. This is the abbreviated version.

My questions:

1. Can they require doctor excuses?

what would help with chronic foot pain?,"so i’ve been dealing with foot pain since i was 14 (im 20 now), and it’s getting really hard to ignore especially when it comes to work. i can only stand still for 15-30 minutes before it starts getting distracting. it was diagnosed as plantar faciitis but it’s in both feet, i’ve never been injured, and despite all the fancy shoes and stretches and whatnot i’ve been given nothing helps, so im not sure if it’s a bad case of that or something else. i can’t get doctors notes/accommodations to sit at my job since it’s not considered a disability/chronic condition, so im just not working right now (my job involves standing for the entire shift.) i really need the money, though. what can i do
to accommodate myself when my job and doctor aren’t being helpful? are there any aids that would work or is sitting the only thing that can possibly help? or am i just being lazy because everyone experiences this?",8,1euuv5r,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1euuv5r/what_would_help_with_chronic_foot_pain/,5,1723936482.0
My boyfriend is a devotee. Should I be concerned?,"So I(23F) started dating my boyfriend(19M) a month ago. We met at college, and he flirted with me, and since he's nice looking, I liked him back and we started dating. I am a wheelchair user with a T1-T2 injury that I've had for 10 years now. I have had intercourse with my boyfriend and he seems to fetishize a lot about my disabled body. Last time he made me a comment of how much my paralyzed legs were attractive to him and it was kinda weird. He has also requested me to try intercourse from my wheelchair, but I feel weird about that. He confessed to me that he has had a kink for attractive women in wheelchairs ever since he was 11, and that when he met me he didn't want to miss the experience of dating a woman in a wheelchair. He is nice and charming, but I still feel weirded out and insecure that the reason he decided to date me was because of my wheelchair, and I see it very weird that he fetishizes my disabled body. Has anyone else on this sub have an experience of dating a devotee?

At what stage do I say if I’m physically disabled or not?,"When I was 14, I broke my leg. Spiral fracture to the femur- not fun. 

Point is, the ligaments in my leg are loose. I’m trying to find a therapist but currently I don’t have one. It’s not a big deal, but every now and then (about every 2-4 months) my leg locks up. It can last just a morning- or it can last 3 weeks. It makes it painful to fully stretch it, if impossible, and often I can’t bend it fully back either.

Recently it seems something else (maybe my kneecap) might be popping out of place too. 
The thing is, I’m told it’s fixable. With physical therapy i should be fine. If it’s too severe, I might need surgery. 

I am autistic and I have accommodations for that already, but I feel like it would be misleading if I started asking for accommodations for my leg as well. I don’t know if I should get a cane- as I’ll only need it once every three months- if that.

Travelled with someone who did not take my disability seriously ,"Hello! I recently went on a 1-week trip with someone I thought was my friend. I have endometriosis, which is considered a disability for me, and some other mental issues that don't really matter in this story.

I told her multiple times before leaving that I wouldn't be able to walk fast or do certain things. She said it was fine. 
Once there, she kept complaining that I wasn't walking fast enough. I told her that I couldn't, she apologised, but she did it again the next days. 
We had a huge fight in front of the Cologne Cathedral because I was taking a break, too long for her (3 minutes). I was having an endo flare-up. The pain feels like birthing a child. 
Anyway! I left her to go back to the hotel, and once she arrived, I told her I was leaving her to stay with my German friend. 
At first, she acted as if nothing ever happened, but then she kept apologising with tears, she somehow managed to say it was my fault and that I shouldn't let that ruin the trip. 
She probably thought she would get away with it again. I'm a patient and honest person, when something is wrong, I explain it to people calmly. But I was so angry that I screamed at her. 

After staying with my German friend, I had to go to the last hotel.. with her. I tried to understand why she did not take me seriously. 
She replied with a bunch of selfish arguments, saying it's her way of thinking blablabla... 

She also told me a few months before that I should be ashamed of getting a disability allowance cause people have worse... I feel so ashamed that I was friend with that girl for 14 years. I always thought she was being brainwashed by her parents, so each times I would explain to her that she was wrong. And I thought she understood, but apparently not.

Wrist disability after work injury. Might get fired because of it. Has anyone been fired from a long term job because of on the job injury?,"Long story short, I got injured at work and it never healed properly/workmans comp is blaming it on family history. My doctor released me to normal duties even though I have pain. HR is now involved and wants to know what accommodations are needed. Talked about the ADA and how they could see if there is a better position for me but ""they aren't required to make me a spot"". So hint at firing me? I keep hoping it will get better. Maybe with a few days off to rest which I never got during workmans comp. Hoping I can have accommodations that my job will be okay with but it's production work so it's doubtful. All I use is my hands at work, doing small tasks. My 4 year anniversary is coming up, same with my birthday. So we will see if they decide to pull a really nasty move.

Not allowed to use the restroom ,"Our little girl was born with complex craniosynostosis. She also has mild to moderate autism, which is probably related to the cranio. All of the growth plates in her skull were closed at birth, and she's had two surgeries for this condition and will have her third surgery next month, along with a surgery on the bone structure and muscles around her eyes. She is potty-trained and has been for a while. However, she doesn't always have a lot of notice before she needs to visit the restroom. She rides the school bus, which is one of the highlights of her day. However, the ride lasts about 45 minutes, and once they arrive at the school, they must wait 10 - 15 minutes before they're allowed to disembark. Last week, she had to use the restroom so badly when she arrived at school that the bus driver got one of the school staff members to let her use the restroom and return to the bus. We're now being told that she'll never be allowed in the school to use the restroom again before the busses unload because having one of the staff interact with the students at that time of day is a union violation. I know that this situation will occur again, and she'll end up wetting her pants. I believe that this is an ADA violation for failure to make reasonable accommodations. Still, I would like to find out if anyone else has had a similar situation and how they resolved it.

Don't buy items >$1k from Amazon with Third Party Fulfillment ,"How this affects our community is at the end.

I bought a laptop for ~$2k, but didn't know the risks involved with such an expensive purchase when using Amazon's Third Party Fulfilment. I bought it at the end of May and after being told by the company that they'd rather give me a refund than a working device (seriously), I agreed to take a refund at the end of June. I had their defective merchandise in the mail within a few hours only to be told that they wanted to inspect their junk before returning my money. Which to this day, they never have.

Since then I have spoken with around 10 different Amazon representatives to try to get my money back. I had people who tried to help, claimed to try, outright lied about taking steps they never did, a couple who ended chats prematurely, and some who just transferred me as soon as they understood that my issues went beyond their control. Apparently Amazon is ok with third party sellers scamming people on their website if they know how to game the system and now I've learned that they really don't want to help the disabled either!

After this going on for almost two months and severely damaging my personal business both monetarily and in reputation since I couldn't fulfill some orders, I have started asking for managers. (I know I'm a pushover on this stuff, I'm working on it.) The supervisor I spoke to last week claimed he was submitting a request to his supervisors to look into it and repeatedly assured me he'd be surprised if I didn't get my money back, but obviously that didn't happen. In fact, one I spoke to today informed me that they didn't submit anything. I asked to speak to their supervisors since the second tier of Amazon Customer Service can only authorize refunds up to $1k. That is when they said that I could set up a call back, but the tier after them doesn't engage in text chats.

I cannot hold up a phone for too long without some serious pain so that is obviously not going to work for me and I informed them of that. At that point, they started evading my questions even more and refused to explain why their supervisors couldn't accommodate my disability or what they'd do if I were deaf. They eventually ended the chat without a word and sent me to someone who stonewalled and sent ridiculous platitudes while avoiding my questions before selecting a resolution where they politely ask the scammers for my money back without telling me how to painlessly talk to people with the authority to do something.

So now I'm here warning all of you that not only will Amazon help scammers who sell defective merchandise keep your money almost two months after receiving their crap back with ridiculously illogical protocols (ex. The value of items being too high to authorize and the request for my money had to be restarted because they lied about intending to return it instead of ignoring the request), but they will offer no reasonable accommodations for your disabilities if you have trouble with phone calls.",0,1euyaj2,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1euyaj2/dont_buy_items_1k_from_amazon_with_third_party/,13,1723946857.0
Dealing with Inspiration Porn?,"One of my teacher was talking about how she wanted this years theme to be determination and no excuses. Ok thats fine, the typical beginning of year stuff. Then she started talking about this man she met who biked 60 miles on harsh terrain with only one arm and one leg. Don't get me wrong, thats extremely impressive and inspiring, but then. She gets so emotional about it that she starts CRYING. I'm sitting there like. This is weird. She continues to bring up various accomplished disabled people and ends up close to full on bawling bc she's so inspired.

She ends finishes her speech out with a ""You know these people are getting up everyday and doing amazing things. They don't complain or feel sorry for themselves. You should be able to get through your math classes"" which like. ehhhhhhhhhhh.  We all just sit there awkwardly because?? what else are we supposed to do??  Several other students (including myself) are disabled which really just makes it awkward. 

How do you handle this? I have a feeling it might happen again (this is not my first class with her and this type of thing has appeared before)(not quite as bad though)



TLDR: my teacher keeps showing us accomplished disabled people, getting so emotional about it she cries, then says we have no excuses. considering several classmates (as well as myself) are disabled its very weird and awkward.

Things that still amaze me after leaving my adult group/foster home ,"I have the ability to make my own medical decisions based on my needs, how I feel, my wants and my diagnosis. No one is avoiding taking me to the doctor or ER just because I don’t seem bad enough. I hide pain and illnesses as a trauma response… I never look as bad as I actually feel…

I can come and go as I please

I can spend my money as I want to

I don’t have to live with roomates who scare me half to death with their behavior (not all of them were that bad but staff never did much about the ones who were)

No toxic staff gaslighting, blaming, judging and making assumptions about 

I have the ability to choose to stop meds if the side effects are too much or I just rather take something else

I have the ability to choose a non-medicated or minimally medicated treatment plan 

I can get resources and career opportunities without a process that takes so long that I completely lose the opportunity

If I feel threatened or get hurt and it’s bad enough to get the police involved I can do so without wasting precious time on a process

If I need to go to the ER I can do so immediately instead of wasting time on another harmful process

I’m able to learn valuable life skills now because I have free access to my entire home now. Clients weren’t allowed to cook at all the foster/group homes I was in 

I can get a pet when I’m ready

I can keep most of my SSI (rent in those homes is all but like $200 of your SSI)

I can put my phone in DND without getting in trouble 

I’m not treated like a child anymore and I’m not put Into situations I’m definitely not able to cope with just because someone else doesn’t actually care about what’s best for me but wants to seem like they do

No more unfair power dynamics at home

I can lock my bedroom door

I can do things on my own time

Do you believe my mother could be accepted for disability based on her medical history?,"I believe she applied when she had breast cancer when I was underage and was denied.  I wasn’t of age to be more involved to know about why she was denied. 

Today, she is 63. Has years of history of depression. She’s been on anti depressants for years. Gets off, and soon after needs to get back on.  Now that I am older, I can tell when she’s been off of them because she has paranoia and feels like a burden to everyone.  Has had suicidal ideation that she’s never mentioned to the doctors but has opened up to me about it. That is one of her diagnoses. 

Second being her GI issues that she cannot find a solution for.  The doc prescribed her so many things for diarrhea. She travels with a portable toilet.  Wears diapers sometimes when she knows there might not be a bathroom nearby.  Has had several colonoscopies. More than the recommended amounts for her age. 

Only reason I am looking into this now after all these years is because they financially need it. They have always been low income but with the inflation these days (California) things are getting rough for them.  I help where I can but I am in school. My dad is 63 and does not plan to retire until 66 or 67 to get a better amount.  My mom cannot retire because she is short two credits for social security.

Should I ask my doctor about mobility,"It hurts when I stand still for more than 5 minutes because of my double jointed legs. So when my legs are in their natural position my knees bend the other way which actually ends up hurting my legs unless I force my legs to bend normally. 

I have asthma and a heart condition that makes my chest hurt when i jog more than one or two laps in school. its also very common for me to get nausea and I get frequent headaches.

the thing is its not just my feet hurt it’s my back and my neck to that hurts

I’ve thought it was normal to not be able to stand for more than 5 minutes without my knees or my back hurting. But it’s not!

I also like walking so if I were to get a mobility aid it wouldnt be a wheel chair. I feel like having a cane with another mobility aid would be super useful. I can use a cane on one of my amazing days and the other on my less than good ones. (Something like rollater or forearm crutches.)

the only bad thing is I kinda feel like I’m faking it or that I shouldn’t want a Mobililty aid since I’m young or that im not disabled enough.

Double standard for OCD vs Autism : why?,"Online and in real life: people use both terms incorrectly. However I’ve only seen people stand up for OCD. If someone tries to defend Autism, they are told off. 

—


Example: “omg my dog is so OCD, he only walks between the lines” 

Public response: “that’s not what OCD is. It’s offensive to use OCD incorrectly and lightly to make fun of a situation with your dog.”

——

Example: “omg all he does is play guitar all day, he’s so autistic lol” (bf is not autistic) 

Public response: “haha! The tism!! He’s so restarded. My bf must be neurospicy too ha!” 

One person says: “hey actually that’s not how autism works. Autism is a real thing, and making a joke out of it isn’t ok” 

Publix response: “shut up! It’s just a joke. Ugh, they must be autistic. You’re no fun at parties.” Or the rare claim “I’m autistic and I think it’s ok.” ",74,1etngq1,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1etngq1/double_standard_for_ocd_vs_autism_why/,42,1723811263.0

Do you know that feeling… ,"Salem Alykom or Hi, 

Do you know that feeling when you fall down from your wheelchair… 
and you can never pick yourself ip again..
and ultimately you need the help of a family member or friend..
but it’s sooo complicated to use only strength to lift you up.. 
and you need to give them directions how to handle you and lift each part of your body in a certain way to actually be able to move you in way that doesn’t hurt you.. 
While you are at your lowest and most vulnerable situation you need to maintain a certain rational mindset in order to help others help you.. 

It’s like you need to put your emotions on hold… 
But do we actually really put it on hold…

"'Learning to come to terms with my newly broken body.' Or 'it's amerika, st*pid'","I had a good cry this morning.

I went from 5-6 hour days at the barre to stuck at home. seems to be where it all started.   
what began with a twinge in my lower back eventually became a full on disability in my lumbar and sacrum.   
i can't stand for more than ten minutes at a time. can't sit, can't walk without a cane, and for more than half an hour. I need lay-down breaks throughout the day. the pain is excruciating. i feel something clunking and popping, and when I do my old stretches, my husband can hear it from across the room. 

it's been like this for a couple years now. getting progressively worse. 

when I married my husband this last February, I got on his insurance. it's good insurance since he works at a hospital. but stilll, I am 'not allowed' to get an MRI that the doctor ordered because the insurance denied it, in lieu of 6 months rehab, which seems to be only aggravating my joints in my sacrum, NOT HELPING.

Giving my daughter the gift of the outdoors with my ebike. ,"My 5 year old daughter has quad CP, and I've always wanted to find ways to share my love for the outdoors with her. She lights up whenever we're outside, and I cherish those moments.  A couple of months ago, I had an idea: what if I could modify an e-bike to safely take her on rides with me? I did some research and decided on the Freedare Eden Step-thru. It's sturdy, comfortable, and has plenty of power for two.  Then I got to customization. I added a front-mounted seat, found a sturdy child bike seat designed for mounting on the frame. I welded custom brackets to the front of the e-bike's frame to securely attach the seat. On harnessing I used a five-point harness, similar to what you'd find in a car seat, to keep her secure. I then fabricated adjustable footrests that attach to the bike's frame, so her feet wouldn't dangle. I also added a small plexiglass windscreen to her seat to deflect bugs and wind.

Seeing the smile on her face on our first ride made all the effort worthwhile. We go on rides together now all the time, and it's become one of her favorite things to do. It's amazing how something as simple as feeling the wind in your hair and enjoying the scenery can bring so much joy.

I'd love to hear from other parents or caregivers of children with disabilities. What are some of your favorite activities to do together?

Really struggling and don't know what resources are available to me,"I created an account just to post here. It has been a really rough couple of months for me. I suffer from depression and OCD which have made it hard for me to get, let alone maintain, a job. It took me forever just to get over the initial panic to go to a job and survive the first day. With more time and better understanding of my condition, I have been able to stay longer, but the longest I have been in a job is a year and two months. I either can't get the accommodations I need to function (primarily flexible schedule for my numerous appointments) or the stress I feel from my OCD boils over to the point where I simply can't be in that job any longer.

I quit my last job on the spot due to this. It's been really devastating mentally and financially. It feels like I keep digging myself into a deeper hole. I no longer have insurance, which I desperately need with my appointments and medications. And I can't seem to find a replacement job. I've gotten a handful of interviews where I feel like I've done well but still can't manage to land the actual job. Part of it feels like it's due to my disability. I know that ADA is built upon REASONABLE accommodations, so I try to bring up that I have one, to avoid wasting time for both parties. I don't want to do that, as once again, it feels like I am being dismissed as a candidate due to it. But on the other hand, I don't want to go through the whole onboarding process just to learn I will have to skip out on all my psychiatrist/therapy/doctor appointments in order to keep the job. I need some help in some way. I can't keep paying out of pocket for all my expenses, I am stacking up my debt and financially burdening my family just to get by.

Had to cancel on new friends…,"A new friend has a birthday this weekend where the plans have changed like three times. The first (a bar) would have been hard but manageable as I could have left early and not drank, the second (a restaurant) even more doable, the third (a sleepover) absolutely not doable, and the last (small gathering at a persons apartment) was going to be a several hours long affair with drinking and smoking. For context, diagnosed with severe ME/CFS, dysautonomia (IST w/ hypotension), hypermobility (need gene testing still but almost certainly HSD/hEDS), vestibular migraines.

The several hours which included cooking was not at all realistic but I still wanted to go for a couple hours. However, I’m crashing/flaring this week and even lost the ability to walk for awhile the other night. I’m not doing so great with walking even now and am a fall risk. So I asked if I could bring my partner who helps take care of me (which also, wouldn’t even be that odd as someone else’s partner will also be there). 

They cited space in the apartment, so I said that if there wasn’t space for her there certainly wasn’t space for my rollator or for me to lay down to regulate my heartrate if needed. And that I wouldn’t be able to attend. Why tf would I choose to put myself into worse PEM for someone who won’t even let me bring my caretaker or consider my disabilities when planning activities? Or ensure there’s space for me to lay down or use mobility aids. 

I realize I don’t particularly care about burning bridges when they connect to people who can’t or won’t accommodate me. I spent years trying to push through and now I have severe CFS. It’s just not worth it to me. I frankly only want to be friends with other physically disabled or chronically ill people at this point, because it seems like most people who aren’t don’t consider our needs or safety.

before all this allergy nonsense, i was diagnosed with ehlers danlos and postoral orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (EDS and POTS) and was given very little information about both conditions. i don't remember if i specified this or not in my last post but i was only told ""consider losing weight, what are your plans to do that?"" after being given base-line information, by both the specialist who diagnosed me and my PCP. i was not told of any other options like phys therapy and mobility aids (beyond the cane i already had), possible comorbidities that can occur, or even medications that i could take that would alieve my symptoms like propranolol (which i take now).

so, please, imagine my surprise (and anger) when i- a man who has been dealing with moderate to severe allergic reactions for almost two weeks straight, in n out of the hospital- learn of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) which, get this,, *causes each and every one of my symptoms to the exact fuckin letter and is* ***very*** *comorbid with EDS/POTS*. even before my allergies developed, i had MCAS symptoms. i had ""intolerances"" and ""sensitivities"" that i just assumed were par for the course of EDS or maybe even my autism. ***but there was another, more likely fuckin explanation that i was never even made aware of because my oh so concerned doctors had more thoughts about my weight than the life altering, life-long medical conditions that they confirmed i had.***

if there are any medical professionals reading this, please take my advice in some way: do **not** withhold **anything** about your patients' conditions from them, especially when it's something that could put them in the hospital *over five separate fuckin times* and need emergency IV for two of them.

What are my options?,"I’ll try and make this as condensed as possible:

I’m a 26F in Indiana who was approved for disability a year ago, and first applied 2.5 years ago. In September I’m reaching the limit of being on Medicaid and will be transitioned to Medicare. 

After going through an FSSA interview, I was approved for MAL financial aid. I was not eligible for dual eligibility due to making about $65 too much monthly in disability benefits. So my Medicare premiums and stuff will be covered, but I won’t have dental or vision insurance. 

I have very bad teeth due to the medications I take, so a good dental plan (that I can afford) is crucial. Vision is also important, but less so, as my vision issues are covered under medical. 

First: is there a way I can decrease my monthly disability payments so I can qualify for dual eligibility? I would rather get less monthly than not have insurance. 

Second: if that’s not possible, what are my dental option? What’s the best plan? Are there more financial aid options if I can’t cover the dental insurance costs?

How do you roll over in bed if you can’t move your legs?,"Hi everyone,

My grandmother has a back injury which got worse and worse with time, and doctors were afraid of operating on her because of her age. Today she cannot feel her legs nor move them. Worth noting is that she is also over weight.

She needs help with most types of movement like getting up from bed, laying down or moving around. Most of this is no problem for us, because she is our grandmother and it is our duty to help her all the time.

When sleeping she prefers to sleep on her sides because sleeping on her back is painful. After some hours of sleep she wakes up in the middle of the night and calls us to roll her over because her arm and body get tired from the weight and position. Thereafter she can continue her sleep for another few hours before we receive another call.

I thought I might get some tips from people in this sub that have experienced similar problem or have a solution for rolling over in bed without assistance when having no control over the legs.

I really hate how many stories I hear about people with actual service animals getting a hard time in day to day life because other people keep bringing their pets/emotional support animals into businesses and claiming they're service animals. I love that there isn't a barrier of having to prove your animal is a service animal right now, but I wonder if it would be worth the trouble to have a program or something to officially license/certify that an animal is in fact a service animal so that all of the people who are abusing the openness of the current system can no longer do so. 

Off the top of my head, I can't really think of a format of identification (ex. ID card, vest, documentation, collar tag, etc.) that couldn't be forged, but like, we have driver's licenses and those get scanned when you buy weed (in states like mine where it's legal) and a fake ID wouldn't work for that (I think?) so couldnt there be some system to do something like that for service animals? 

My instinct is that requiring folks to get a license would likely turn into too much of a barrier to be accessible to the people who need it. But still, I wonder if there isn't some way to make this situation better. 

Thoughts? 

+++++++

EDIT: Thanks for all of the dialogue here, everyone. It's really great to hear from all of you, especially those who are most impacted by this. The gist I'm getting is that it's a fucking pain that people abuse the system but it's much better than making the service inaccessible to people who need it. 

I read one comment that said something like ""I'm happy to see more dogs around if it means people who need service animals get to have them"" and it made me think about how as a dog lover, I generally would love to see more dogs around **if they are well trained enough for the environment.** As a dog parent, I have loads of places I wish I could take my dog with me, but also loads of places that I would never take my dog even if I were allowed to bc I know it would be overwhelming for my dog, me or both of us. I wonder what the world would be like if we just generally allowed more dogs places, with the caveat that they must be well-behaved, leashed, etc.  *and* that pet owners and business owners would actually adhere to that. 

I don't know that we're going to find a perfect solution on this thread, but I'm glad to be having this conversation so that we get closer to it!",16,1et6jiw,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1et6jiw/what_does_the_community_think_of_the_creation_of/,35,1723756047.0

Ambulatory Wheelchair ,"I have a question. I am an 18 year old female born with rheumatoid arthritis that went undiagnosed for 11 years. This caused me to damage my joints severely. Past couple days me and my friends have been going around and doing somethings together before school starts. Two days ago we were walking around the mall and we spent some time doing airsoft. Yesterday we went to the fair. My legs have been killing me. Today we went to a theme park. I decided to ask about using a mobility aid such as a wheelchair because I didn’t think I’d be able to get through the entire day.

I’m questioning if this was right. Because I can walk long distances and stand for long distances but I was using it to spare the pain on my joints. And I got a lot of strange looks. Was I in the wrong? At what point should I be using a wheelchair or other aids? Am I taking a resource away from someone who needs it more? Should I have just walked and dealt with the pain?

ADA Seating?,"Recently I bought ADA Seating for a concert, and I’m wondering if I’m still allowed to sit in those chairs with an invisible disability. 

For reference, I have terrible anxiety, and take both anxiety meds as well as beta blockers to control it, but in situations like concerts, theatres, and airplanes, where I’m in close proximity with many people it often gets a lot worse. In these situations, I get fainting spells, nauseous, and my whole body begins to shake and I can‘t walk or function super well. My therapist told me that ADA seats have extra space as they need to be compatible for wheelchair users and their companions, so it may be a good idea to try an ADA seat as I won‘t be so tightly compact with other people. 

I’m really anxious about this because I have huge fears and anxiety issues about the way that people perceive me, and if you think I’ll be getting dirty looks or questions the whole night I probably just wont go 😭

Even thinking about it makes me want to throw up and die, but I should be going to this concert to get over this fear, so let me know what you guys think. Is it ok for me to use that seat?",7,1etcn1t,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1etcn1t/ada_seating/,15,1723772374.0
How do I learn to live with a disability? ,"I’m 23f and I have a disability known as erbs palsy. Mine was very severe I believe more than one of my nerves were completely ripped from my spinal cord. My affected arm is shorter, atrophied, and basically useless. I can’t use my fingers or wrist at all, straighten my arm, and the highest I can lift it is around my heart. 

Throughout school I would only wear hoodies to hide my arm and pants to hide the two giant scars that go up the back of my calves from a nerve transfer surgery (even in 90 degree weather) I would never talk to anyone because I was and still am scared of people finding out. I would go to the bathroom and burst into tears if I had to do group projects or just skip class. 

They way my arm looks makes me so insecure I still only wear hoodies now even by myself because I can’t look at my arm I’m so ashamed and embarrassed somehow. I shower in the dark, I never look in mirrors. I wish I could wear dresses, tank tops, skirts, anything cute but I feel so hideous. I get so upset when my friend gets to wear cute things but I look like a badass psycho from the game borderlands. My arm is deformed and it makes me feel so unfeminine like I can’t be beautiful because women shouldn’t be flawed. I know I’ll never be conventionally attractive, it shouldn’t bother me but it destroys me because I could of been so pretty. I don’t date because I know men are visual creatures and I know my body is disturbing due to deformities and multiple scars from surgery and self harm. 

Then I have to deal with the fact I’ll never be able to play guitar or any other instrument I’m interested in. Like I wanted to be in a band so bad but I can’t. I can’t play guitar and i have severe panic attacks when I have to do any task in front of people even my best friend I’ve had since kindergarten. Sometimes I hate everyone because they don’t suffer like I do. When I was a kid and would blow out my birthday candles I would wish to be a normal girl and have a normal arm up until I was 11. That’s when I realized it was never going to happen. I took it so seriously to, I wouldn’t tell anyone just because I wanted it to come true so badly and if you wanted your wish to come true you couldn’t tell anyone. 

I’ve seen people with my diss say as they get older they start hanging problems in the non affected arm from using it so much so now I have that to look forward to. I can’t believe this is all I have to look forward to. My body getting more disabled. I just don’t know what to do with my life. My disability and scars make me less desirable and takes away everything I ever wanted for myself. I’m so heartbroken and lost I don’t know how to handle these things. I’m sorry if this is a mess I just need help from people that also struggle I’m a mess.

I’m disabled but undiagnosed & need food- what do I do?,"ETA: I cannot go to the store or a food bank or really anywhere that has cardboard, single-use plastic, or paper as they all contain formaldehyde and will cause me to faint, vomit, or have a seizure in large quantities. I’m also too sick to drive anywhere and don’t have access to public transport. 

I have been very sick for a year now. Thanks to r/Mold, I finally got some help figuring out the cause after the healthcare system repeatedly failed me. I am still waiting to see an immunologist and do not have an official diagnosis yet, but I’m 99% sure that I have Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. 

Long story short, my once mild allergies have become so severe that they are debilitating and I am not able to leave the house much. One of these allergies is formaldehyde, so grocery stores are out of the question. I’m not able to afford food a lot of the time and I have become so underweight that it’s affecting my menstrual cycle. I was a runner before I got sick and in excellent health, and now I can barely keep myself and my small apartment clean, let alone have the energy to do much else. 

How can I get food delivered? I can’t exactly work right now and applying for disability can take years.

The link is to context of my situation.

I received this response from HR today:

Good morning,
 
We have received your message and we are reviewing the situation. You can expect a response before the end of the month on next steps.
 
As of this point, there is still no accommodation granted, and your schedule will remain as has been designated by (Supervisor) and (Director). If you have concerns in the meantime, please reach out to (Supervisor) or (Director) directly.
 
Thank you!

They were pretty quick to say no the last 2 times so I’m wondering why it’s taking this long to get an answer. I saw that HR and my managers spoke this morning before they sent this email to me so why didn’t they come up with a decision then? I mean I did corner them with the truth and facts so maybe they are going to actually learn about employment disability laws before they answer me. 

Im super nervous because the commute to work is physically making me sick and I don’t want my work to suffer because my employer decided to break the law and cover it up just because my able bodies coworkers want to lay in their pjs all day.

Doctor seems less concerned about my test results than he should be,"I’ve had a series of symptoms the past 3.5 years with little to no answers. I have pretty bad chronic fatigue, some heart issues, random episodes of paralysis, really intense Deja Vu symptoms that include facial numbness and brain fog, brain fog in general, joint pain at night, dizziness and loss of balance… for years I’ve been pushing for tests and referrals to specialists and it’s been really difficult to get doctors to take me seriously (my primary has recently been reminding me that I have a referral for a psychiatrist when I bring up my symptoms). 

Yesterday I had another appointment with my primary and we decided to do more bloodwork and this time my “TSH WITH REFLEX TO FT4” (I copied this from MyChart so apologies if it doesn’t make sense) is 10.7 when the recommended max is 4.5. I was doing research on this and it seems to basically mean I have “overt hypothyroidism”. Doing more research I noticed that almost every single issue I have can be a symptom of this, or associated with thyroid problems. It even is connected to health issues I hadn’t even considered to be related to my thyroid. I’m sure this may seem weird, but I was almost excited about the results because it showed that it’s not all in my head, and when reading up on the treatments I saw that most people who took the medication were relieved of their chronic fatigue issues within a few weeks. 

I just got a note from my doctor that says “Elevated TSH with normal FT4, no med changes at this time but we should continue to monitor thyroid function.” I feel incredibly disappointed, especially because my symptoms are debilitating and I’ve been unemployed for 2 years and am currently applying for disability. I would much rather have my life back than sit around monitoring my thyroid.

I have a question about my wife's disability and I don't really know where to get clear answers. may I ask for some advice?,"My wife has postprandial BM or Dumping syndrome. She can work but needs to be able to access a restroom quickly. She didn't declare that she was disabled when she was hired as her symptoms were not that severe prior to 2022. I want to know what is truly considered disabled in this situation?

Her doctor previously requested for accomodations for access to the restroom and frequent visits to the restroom throughout the day.  She has been diagnosed with postprandial BM and I wanted to know if she needs to file with the state as having a disability so that her employer will not be able to discriminate against her.

I say that because they have placed her on an immediate leave until they receive a clearer explanation of her condition, stating that the doctors note provided to them did not list a reasonable accommodation that was clearly outlined and they were unsure how to comply with her medical needs.

It seems to me that they were just trying to pick on her. My wife just wants this to stop and continue to work. I am currently trying to get a lawyer but we are not wealthy and I don't know where to get more information.

Every place I call the attorneys office takes my name and number and says that they can't really do anything until they fire her, I want to get her legal counsel while she is working and get her employer off her back. Any pointers? I live in California (at will state) if that matters at all.

I need something where the answer is the same every single time and there are guidelines on how to solve things without having to look into them. Idk if that makes sense, lol. 

  
Remote call center jobs are a no. I've worked two and they made me suicidal. 

  
I am desperate to do some form of work so that mine and my partner's finances are not so tight and so that I can have some independence.

Why do people think I'm lying?,"Why does people think I'm lying about my situation or about my age?

People have accused me being a minor when I say things like ""my mom doesn't allow me to do this"" or when I ask if ""something requires an ID"". Then when I tell them about my situation or that I'm disabled or neurodivergent they accuse me of lying about *that* because ""that's something catfishers would say when catfishing"".

Don't people know disabled adults and neurodivergent adults *do* exist? Haven't people heard of overbearing parents that infantalizes their disabled/neurodivergent adult sons or daughters?

And so what if I don't ""sound neurodivergent or disabled"" to you or if I'm well-spoken and coherent to you. That doesn't make it okay to doubt whether or not I have a disability. I'm only going by what my mom has told me and what I've seen on the paperwork. So if I'm not really disabled, then either I was misdiagnosed or either my mom fooled a bunch of doctors when I was a little kid lmao. But my official diagnosis is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder because my birth mom drank alcohol (and did cocaine) when she was pregnant with me. So I definitely have *something* which explains the paperwork.

I believe I am disabled or neurodivergent but just not to the point where my mom thinks I am and not to the point where I need to be controlled and sheltered like this. But try telling my mom that. I was even told in the legal advice sub that if I left home my mom could call the cops and have them bring me back and tell them I'm incompetent and it'll be her word over mine since I'm officially diagnosed with a mental disability.

But if it's socially UNacceptable to accuse somebody of lying about rape (**as it should be**), then why is it socially acceptable to accuse a disabled or neurodivergent adult of lying about not only being disabled or neurodivergent but *also* accuse them of lying about being in a situation where their overbearing parents shelters them and not let them do hardly anything that typical adults (or even teens, for that matter) gets to do. Just because it isn't something you can fathom or imagine doesn't mean it isn't happening. How is that any different than accusing a sex abuse victim or domestic violence victim of lying, since you're still accusing somebody of lying about something that they are experiencing or going through, or have experienced or went through?

Yes, my mom allows me to have a phone, as controlling and overbearing as she is; and she doesn't check it. But if she did found out about me doing something she doesn't approve of (such as being on social media or dating sites, which I do behind her back), she will take my phone or at least try to. And she does tell me who I can and can't talk to but I talk to people behind her back (the people she doesn't like or approve of, usually for superficial or judgy reasons). And I've been accused of using ""sock puppet"" accounts because I don't have pictures of me on public where everyone can see them and I don't have myself as my profile picture (usually a peace sign or an animal or flower). Well, I'm sorry if I offended you because I'm trying to keep people who knows me irl from coming across my profile and then telling my mom (which did happen years ago back when I was a lot less careful then I am now and yes I was over 18 then).

Yes, I'm on the Bumble app but I saved up money to pay for Bumble Premium (lifetime fee, which you pay one time and I paid with a Google Play card) so I could hide my profile and only the people I swipe right on sees my profile and I'm careful about who I swipe right on. This reduces the risk of my mom finding out I'm on Bumble. If I do meet anyone on there that I like, of course I wouldn't tell my mom that I met them on an app.

Yes, I get to be home alone. But she always makes sure to tell me to keep the doors locked before she leaves. And if I invite anyone over while I'm home alone (like I want to) and she finds out about it, that will be my last time staying home alone.

And another thing. Fear is a real thing. Just because somebody is afraid doesn't mean they're happy in their environment or that they don't want things to change or that they're seeking attention by talking about their situation that you may or may not believe is true. Sometimes talking about things just helps them cope with it, especially if they are too afraid to do anything about it.

And on top of people not believing me about my situation, I also have very bad health anxiety that has me convinced I'm dying which I feel helpless to do anything about and its to a point now where some people are thinking I'm attention-seeking because I keep talking about it and haven't done anything about it. But what can I do when my mom is ""over me"" and I feel like I have no power or voice? I'm not ""attention-seeking"" but I need to talk about it because it keeps me from losing it and keeps me calm and reassured until the health anxiety comes back and then I'm freaking out again.

I also want to say that not everyone accuses me of lying or attention-seeking (thankfully) but enough people do that I felt the need to post about it. And maybe get it through peoples heads to not assume someone is lying just because something sounds too bizarre to be true and is coming from an internet stranger.

If both Gypsy and the Turpin kids had got online (behind their parents backs) telling strangers about their situation, would they have been believed or accused of lying? I really wanna know. (I'm not here to debate the Gypsy case, whether she's a victim or not, that's not what this is about). I'm just wondering if she had gotten online telling people about her situation, would she have been accused of lying or catfishing. And I wonder the same about the Turpin kids too.

Do you work for a doctor for free?,"In the past when I went to a medical office, I gave them my driver's license and insurance card and maybe filled out a form on a little clipboard. I gave them the completed form and they gave me back my license and insurance card and that was it.

More and more I'm finding that medical offices expect patients to do the work of the admins. Recently I went to urgent care for a UTI. Before I even left the house I had to photograph and upload both sides of my license and insurance cards (what if you don't have a smart phone?) and do extensive data entry. It took me an hour. 

At the urgent care, an indifferent employee just pointed me to a card table in the restroom. There was a big mess of stuff on the table for all kinds of different issues (drug testing, STI testing, etc.). 

I had to sift through the pile to find the instructions for UTI testing, find the disposable wipes, locate a cup that didn't have a broken seal, write my info on it. 

How many other people had sifted through that same pile and were their hands clean? Gross!! 

The NP who talked to me was very nice but the admin just sat there on her phone the entire time I was there. 

Wtf. I'm the patient, not the admin. When I'm sick, I need *treatment,* not administrative tasks, and I especially don't want to work for free! Minimum wage where I live is like $14.35 an hour.

Seeking Advice for Legal Accommodations for Employing Disabled Folks,"I am a small business owner in Maryland. I employ around 20 part time workers for an extremely easy and simple job. This job can be done by two slow people or by one fast person, and I can afford to spend $20 an hour on getting this work done, so I either employ two people for $10 each, or one person for $20 if that one person can handle it.  
  
Because of the simplicity of the $10 job, the position has historically been popular with folks with disabilities, high school students, or the elderly. This was all well as good, until the minimum wage began to increase to $15. Two people $15 an hour each is $30 total. $30 is what we make in revenue alone, so it is impossible to pay $30 an hour for that position and still operate, so I had to switch to only the $20 role, and I was forced to lay off all my $10 workers if they were not able to keep up at the $20 rate.

This has worked fine for the business, I have no trouble at all finding enough capable $20 an hour workers, but this was really hard on the people I used to employ, and even now I get a lot of applicants with disabilities who want to work here, many of which can still make it at $20 an hour and I still hire without an issue such as folks with speech or mobility impediments which doesn't affect their productivity, but others cannot. Two of my former employees, for example, are both recovering coma patients. They speak slowly and carefully and move shakily and make a lot of mistakes that they DO fix ok on their own, but it takes time. I hate not being able to employ them, they do a great job if they are on a team with someone else, but could never cut it on their own.   
  
I feel there is nothing I can do, that the minimum wage law, which is made to help people, has had unintended consequences on these people. Everyone deserves a chance to work and make money, some of my former employees have begged to just work illegally, but I do not want to take that risk, especially  since I have so many employees already who can do the $20 work just fine.

Is there anything I can do that lets me employ people who cannot work very fast, make a profit, AND follow the law? It feels like I can only do two at at time...

Any help appreciated. And please do not make any personal comments about my choices, I am not here for moral judgement, I am here to try to find employment for people who want to work but can't cut it at $20 an hour. Maybe one day I will be more profitable and can pay two people $15 each, but not at this time.

Women who use mobility aids...Do kids find you approachable?,"Do kids you don't know find you very approachable even when you are using a mobility aid? It occurred to me that perhaps it's a little odd that so many children are not intimidated by my cane despite my being young...it'd be a kinda unknown to most of them so that might be scary? But then again, if they have a grandparent who uses a cane it might be familiar?

I thought I had a resting ""serious face"" but lately I've been noticing how unfamiliar kids don't find me intimidating at all and thus I'm easily approachable. Even when I'm wearing my big sunglasses that take up a lot of space on my face  or I have colorful hair... I've had adults tell me that my resting face and my walk (I stomp like an army general) is intimidating lol.

The only thing I can think is maybe it's because I'm young, short and very plump,  average/(moderately cute on a good day) and wear fun colours often? Maybe I'm more ""grandma coded"" or something? I kinda like the idea of having ""grandma"" or ""Mrs. Claus"" vibes.  

I just had a cute interaction with a toddler who approached me and wanted to take my hand lol. His family was nearby and got a kick out of it.

Part of that is probably an inherited trait from my father, but I was also institutionalized for most of my childhood, as I'd spent it at a school for the blind. I'd developed learned helplessness from being in an environment where the ableist staff basically handicapped us.

Unfortunately your career options are very limited when you can't see. You're basically resigned to either starving musician, troubleshooting humanity, or mundane computer work. I tried the music thing when I was younger, but I hated practicing and performing. Making music just doesn’t feed my soul.

I'm a very social person and enjoy interacting with humans in an informal casual setting, because I don't have to be the problem solver in those situations. However, that’s different when it’s your full time job. Teachers, therapists, social workers, and sometimes even lawyers have to be nurturers to a degree. Doing that every single day of your life is emotionally draining, especially when you yourself are neurodivergent. Compassion fatigue is real. In short, I basically feel trapped in my life.

I have always had a passion for animals. There's just something rewarding about saving their lives. The kind of unconditional love you get from animals is different from humans. If I could see, my dream career would've been a vet. I would've loved to have worked with zoo and marine animals. I would probably have more drive and motivation if there was actually something to be excited about. I’m pretty sure I would not be lazy if my dream career was in the cards for me.",17,1ermi5z,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ermi5z/how_do_you_find_joy_in_every_day_life_when_youre/,8,1723592135.0

Help with pain and being respectful to people.,"I have a rare syndrome where I’m in constant pain and get stiff muscles and muscle spasms, ad have a really hard time walking, (Stiff-Person syndrome, the same syndrome Celine Dion has). And I had OT yesterday, and the therapist wanted me to walk, but I have to push off the chair I sit in with my hands and arms to stand up, and my left hand and arm was extremely painful yesterday and pushing off the chair hurt so much. So I got grouchy at my therapist and kind of yelled at her that I can’t get up and walk. And that went on for a little while. Until I put lidocaine cream on my hand and was able to get up and pivot to a bedside commode. 

But afterward I apologized to my therapist and said I felt bad and didn’t mean to be grouchy and get mad at her.

And now today my mom told me I was so rude to my therapist yesterday.

Did I do something wrong yesterday and was I disrespectful? Or was what I did kind of ok since my left hand and arm was so painful?",8,1ern7pv,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ern7pv/help_with_pain_and_being_respectful_to_people/,8,1723594028.0
Not having a diagnosis makes me feel shame. How to navigate limitations without pushing yourself to hard?,"This is gonna be long and half a rant: I am young, have been having muscle and joint pains since teens (""""growing pains"""" my ass). My joins get irritated easily, occassionally my muscles hurt a lot, but at least that have been happening less often. Random pains in chest that lasted weeks? Happened twice last year, but ""nothing was wrong"" with me, per medical personnel. Just had to get used to it and live on. Occasionally pains were so bad that it triggered suicidal ideation. On top of that something I have mild headaches for a week straight if I'm bit more tired.

I'm jealous of people who talk about their young body just recovering from anything just at 23yo.

I constantly do things even when I feel like I'm sick, in pain or fatigue, because the issues never stop coming up and I feel like if I rest my life would stop. Doctors never act worried when I tell about pains or fatigue, so I have no support nor meds. I usually didn't even have high inflammation levels when I felt like something was very wrong.

I'm used to being strong and know that I can just get over pain and discomfort even when my body is barely taking it- what else is there left to do? Now my body gave up and I got sick again after needing sick leave for fatigue last week. I've had active month emotionally and physically, so now I've been trying to do less in last weeks, but even that is extremely hard.

I can't explain what is wrong to doctors and even to people I care about. Everything feels like my own fault, my limitations are unclear even to me and I can't seem learn how to live with them without shame.

Due to life circumstances it's hard to try getting treatment currently and idk how to fight for it. Something just feels wrong with my body. 

So, my questions are- *How do you learn to navigate your issues without a diagnosis and how do you keep self-compassion in mind even on your worst days?*",18,1erekjb,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1erekjb/not_having_a_diagnosis_makes_me_feel_shame_how_to/,8,1723571877.0

Work standards changed and now I’m out of compliance ,"I’ve worked customer service for the same company for nearly 2 years now. Started as seasonal and got hired on as a permanent employee later on. It is a WFH position and up until a few months ago I was getting stellar feedback from my managers. The company then changed how they were organizing the structure and I no longer was working for the same office or the same time zone, and changed managers twice. 
Before, getting 75%+ on a quality check was perfectly fine and my time required to complete tasks including what they now call “unavailable” was not an issue. Now they are pushing very hard for 100% across the board, which is fine, I’m struggling because the standards feel very robotic but I’m making progress, but on top of those changes my extra time is now a massive problem where there was none before. Between ADHD and PTSD, I have to have extra time after speaking with someone, especially if they were difficult to speak to, because I just have lapses where I struggle to “reconnect” is the best way I can put it. I’m not sure how to discuss with the new manager regarding these things. Working under my old manager is not an option sadly. They refused. Is this something that I start with HR? Am I supposed to talk with my manager first? Should I get my medical documentation set up to send to both in case things go sideways? I’ve probably missed lots of relevant information but I’m a bit scattered so we start here. And if this is not the place to post, apologies in advance.

Disability depression I'm worried about myself ,"My disability and the recognition of it have started to spiral my depression.

To start with I'm in the UK so we have different laws and recognition about disability. So I've been recognised by the Department of Work and Pensions - DWP (Government body - part if the Civil Service) as having Limited Capability for Work Related Activities - LCWRA. I am also in receipt of Extended Personal Independance Payment. And a local council issued bus pass as I am unsafe to drive. I also have medical exemption for the visa of medication & prescriptions.

The National Health Service NHS, have diagnosed my disability and I gave the DWP full access to my medical records. They are getting together a treatment plan, physio, neuro and psych.

All of the above us really positive, yet my depression (I am receiving treatment for that as well), is getting worse. I find myself staring vacantly at the TV, putting off simple tasks until ""tomorrow"". The worst thing is that I find myself, often, returning to bed with the blackout blinds down and lying there not thinking.

The reason I'm posting this is because I'm worried about myself. I have all the concerns about being a ""burden"" on my wife, my kids don't will do nothing. The one silver lining is that my mother in law stays away as she has disability phobia - she used to make quite sick jokes about my conditions until all of the medical paperwork came through.

Anyway thank you for reading this, I may have used the flair incorrectly. And I felt I needed to get this out of my system .",12,1erc524,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1erc524/disability_depression_im_worried_about_myself/,1,1723566004.0
Seeking input on design project from grabber/reach-and-grab tool users,"Hello r/disability 

I'm working on a personal design project to improve these guys:

[the arm with no elbow](https://preview.redd.it/vydbm0dbahid1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=78858b8dd002d7c4da4485db61bfaf3d44d3efbb)

  
This was my senior design project back in mechanical engineering undergrad. At the time I was focused on starting my career, so once I graduated I didn't give it much thought. Recently I've been doing more hobby designing and 3D printing, and this has come to mind as a good challenging design project that could potentially help some people. Back in the day I reached out to a good friend of mine who works with many disabled people, and he gave me some useful critiques of these tools:

* the existing design doesn't give the user an easy way to get whatever is held by the grabber. People have to either do a complicated motion to grab the item with their other hand, or drop the item on themselves 
* it requires the user to hold the trigger the entire time to maintain grip on the item
* it puts a lot of strain on the user's wrist to pick up an item
* expense is a large consideration since disability makes it hard to find work, and insurance is reluctant to pay for such tools

I have a few ideas for how to address some of these issues:

* a retraction mechanism to allow the tool to bring the object in close to the user
* lock the grip and let the user release the trigger without dropping the item
* add an arm brace for increased stability/reduced wrist strain (similar to cuffs on forearm crutches)
* design as many parts to be 3D printed as possible
* open source the design to allow others to modify, manufacture, or improve it however they want to

3D printing has become extremely popular and accessible. In my area all the public libraries have at least one 3D printer, and they'll make parts for you at the cost of the filament which is quite cheap. I'm hoping to have a landed cost of less than $30 to make it as accessible as possible. I don't intend to make any money off of this project. My only goals are to create something useful and hone my design skills. 

I invite anyone who is interested to share their experiences with these tools and give any kind of feedback or recommendations that may be useful. Let me know if you think the features listed would be helpful, or if you think they'd be a waste of effort. I'd particularly like to find some people who would be willing to give me feedback throughout the design process, so if you're interested please message me!",6,1erhhkt,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1erhhkt/seeking_input_on_design_project_from/,1,1723578928.0

Don’t wait for things to get “that” bad before you accept help.  Take a step back and see what might be beneficial, and don’t listen to the people who say “if you sit in that chair, you won’t be able to use your legs at all”.  You decide what is good for you!

Someone claimed I have internalized ableism. Do I?,"Hello, all. Looking to partially vent and also for some opinions. I was diagnosed by my therapist as having level 1 (or low-support level) Autism when I was about 25. I chose to not have it placed on my medical records to avoid potential issues with insurance and such (which, in and of itself is an issue, but not the one to be discussed now). And while I am part of a disabled community, I do not personally refer to myself as disabled. I have no issues with being labeled as disabled, but I just personally feel that my life experience hasn't been affected to that point, especially in comparison to others within my community. 

An individual I got into a bit of a debate with made the statement that I do not get to decide whether or not I am disabled, and that my not considering myself disabled is internalized ableism. I disagree, as I believe it is everyone's individual choice as to how to identify themselves. I also prefer identity-first language because my Autism directly influences how I perceive and interact with the world and is therefore an important aspect of my identity: I am autistic. But, I certainly do not disparage those who prefer person-first language and want to be considered distinct from their disability. Similarly, I would never tell someone with the same  or similar presentation of Autism as me that they are not disabled should they choose to identify as such. 

Do I actually have internalized ableism, or is this person trying to shame me for not conforming to their world view?",71,1eqr5a8,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eqr5a8/someone_claimed_i_have_internalized_ableism_do_i/,70,1723501155.0
Do you feel bad when you don’t help someone disabled? ,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. I think it stems from both of my parents being physically handicapped at different points due to illness, but I always feel compelled to offer help to someone who seems disabled. 

I used to frequently offer help to any person who was wheelchair bound or with a cane. More often than not, when I asked, they said no. Eventually, I learned to “read the room,” so to speak. I learned to distinguish between someone genuinely needing help or someone who is disabled but they got things under control and I would just be annoying and embarrass them if I offered help. Only once in a while, I feel like I read it wrong and I should’ve offered help. 

I think these strong feelings come from both of my parents being physically handicapped at various points. My mom struggled with mobility in the final years of her life. Last year, my dad broke his hip and it was because of lymphoma. He spent half of last year using a walker at home and when we went for his chemotherapy appointments, I pushed him in a wheelchair. He’s only now starting to wean off using a cane outside of the house. 

I had to help both my parents get around, so I guess I feel protective over disabled people. But the last thing I want to do is insult them, because I also know from my parents how embarrassing it can be under certain circumstances. 

Am I making any sense? ",5,1er5ln1,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1er5ln1/do_you_feel_bad_when_you_dont_help_someone/,14,1723549098.0
"I am 18 years old, and feel really alone in my health problems. ","Hi, I am 18m, and I have a lot of undiagnosed issues since over a year back. It feels like every time progress is made, it gets worse. I basically don't get any help. My problems started because of my hips. I used to be really active in the cheerleading community. A few years ago I dreamed to go international, but last year I had to quit because of the pain. 

My hips hurt so much. I can't even lay down without my hips hyper extending in a wrong direction. I discovered it because I couldn't sleep at night due to the pain. 

Adding onto the pain and hips issues, I likely have nerve damage. This leaves especially my legs really, really weak. It's like I can't properly communicate with them. The worst part is the way they tingle though. It never stops, and it's driving me crazy. I can't get them to stop tingling, no matter what I do. It doesn't really hurt, but it makes me want to rip my skin off. 

I am often in pain, always weak and always tired. And since they healthcare sucks where I live, I don't get help for any of it. I don't know if I am ill, or have an injury, or something entirely else.

Vent,"I got certain treatment(TMS) today, and the affect kind of seemed hopeful and i feel frustrated how it went. 

1. I didnt get the full 20min, 
But only like a min though.
Doc thought I was being so sensitive mentally abt it as seeing my reaction and worries (as i have hypochondria) then called it a day. 

I am not sure whether he will keep the treatment with me again when I visit him after. Even so the tratment is kind of not difficult to get here in my country, so I think I can find and visit another place if I want i guess. 

2. I was being ill for very long time, more than a decade, and visited this hospital a lot  and knew that theres this machine. But I thought its expensive(300$ for 20 session, and i definetely could pay for it) even though it wasnt, reminding i dont have proper insurance to cover it. And also cuz of no reason, I always never really have real chance to try it it at all. When I finally asked abt it today, I only had to pay like 15$ for kind of experience. 

Even though i only got the sip of it, I had effect and side effect right away since my body is so sensitive so weak i guess. It always happens to me. I felt my head clear and my body and tooth ache. But as time goes by, the bad side affect kind of went away and still the good one left. Only toothache is kind of still left😢

Though I am not sure if full 20 minute treatment would work in same way( maybe the side effect can go bad i worry too), i kind of expect it can be. But still this uncertainty feels anxious. And I even feel anxious about its hopeful dramatic result, while thinking i neglected it for 10 whole lost years. I always wanted to try it, but somehow I didnt. Like theres some invisible hands or sth. 

Right, its also uncertain I could have been better if I tried it earlier, but it pretty much seems so. And I feel so stupid for

A. Didnt try it for long
B. Didnt try for expense
C. Being stopped by being anxious
D. Not knowing how it will go with full treatment
E. Critisize myself over hopeful probability

Disability hearing coming up,I have my over the phone hearing with a judge coming up. This will be my 3rd attempt and first time with a judge. I have a lawyer. Although my lawyer doesn’t seem too confident in helping me because my doctor’s office is unwilling to write a letter on my behalf. They said they couldn’t write a letter because they are a state facility and it would be a conflict of interest. I was able to get them to send my medical records to my attorney. I have adhd and depression and I have never been able to hold down a job. I’ve gone through so many jobs I’ve lost count. I’m 31 years old and I understand that it is difficult for someone under 50 to get approved for mental Illness. I’m curious why my attorney would want me to go through with the hearing if he doesn’t feel I have a strong case? I feel like nobody is in my corner and I’ve lost the will to keep living at this point. Most days I don’t get out of bed or brush my hair. I’ve been in and out of hospitals since I was 13 and I’m a slow learner. I get overly emotional and frustrated about things that are out of my control and suffer from cry spells everyday. I have tried classes to regulate my emotions and I’m still struggling. I managed to get a small retail job stocking shelves for less than 20 hours a week but I fear that won’t last much longer because i’m too depressed to show up. Any advice on what the hearing will be like. How to respond to questions effectively and what to expect is appreciated. Even though I have a lawyer he didn’t prep me and I feel like i’m going in this alone. ,4,1eqzxnj,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eqzxnj/disability_hearing_coming_up/,7,1723526816.0
"My brother just rubbed it in my face how much more he’s earning than I am, and I can’t believe he’d do that...","My brother just rubbed it in my face how much more he’s earning compared to me, and I can’t believe he’d do that. Especially since I’m currently unemployed, he flaunted his salary increase and bragged about how much more he makes, even suggesting that I’ll never earn as much as he does (It’s most likely true, but why rub it in your brother’s face?). It’s beyond me how someone can be so lacking in empathy.

Why would he want to boast about his success when he knows I’m struggling due to my disability? **It’s not about being envious of his money, I’m genuinely hurt and disappointed by his lack of empathy.**

It’s heartbreaking to see that the last person in my family I expected to be so insensitive is my own brother. I thought he would be understanding and supportive, but it looks like I was wrong… Some people just don’t seem to be able to put themselves in other people’s shoes. I just don’t get it. At least I can now say with 100 percent certainty that everyone in my immediate family has a personality made of garbage.

Not sure what to ask for (work accommodations),"[this has also been posted in r/POTS, and it was suggested to post here]

Going to apologize now for this being wordy but I’m unsure on what to ask for but NEED advice. 

I’ve been diagnosed with POTS since January- so all of this is still relatively new for me to even understand myself and my own body. I also have hEDS (shocker).
I recently started an in office job that I’m about to hit my 90 days at. This is the first in office position I have worked since 2018, previously has all been remote. It’s a great gig, I really enjoy it, and the team is very kind. Even my boss is a nerd like me and very supportive and empathetic to my health. HR was also made aware of my conditions once I was hired. They seem very alright about everything. Got me a nice chair for my office, cool with me taking breaks, and said I can work remotely if needed. I asked if they (HR) needed me to acquire any medical documentation to keep on hand - she said not to worry about it unless there is some really specific accommodation I needed they haven’t been able to fulfill. 

Now, here’s where things get a little.. odd. The job originally was posted as a hybrid role. I opted to work in office since this is a whole new industry for me and for the position I work in (marketing coordinator) I need the education. They said they were fine for this to “work into a hybrid role”. Cool. No biggie. 
A few weeks ago I had a POTS episode. I take meds, do the lifestyle adjustments and changes, everything. But as most things with our bodies, things just happen. I had to leave early because my heart rate was “rubber banding” even while sitting still. Bossman was cool with it, even asked me to text him when I got home just for him to know I was alright (he was concerned). Well, HR had a fucking field day. I got this email from her making it out like I told them this was under control and it isn’t, and that this happens often. It’s happened one literal time since I started here. I also went home, got settled worked remote, then worked remote that following day. I took it seriously because the following week I was scheduled to go out of town for a conference. So since that, NOW they want documentation. ???? Wtf? 
So in my mind - alright, bet. I’ll get that to keep on hand, because I DO know my ADA rights very very well. I doubt that would become the case, but maybe I’m just hopeful. To me it just sounds like she’s doing too much for the sake of her own job. 

My question really is, what accommodations should I ask for? My boyfriend thinks I should ask for remote work, one so I don’t have to deal with HR at all and I can just work like I typically do (I have a crazy work drive that sometimes gets the best of me). My fear is asking for remote or hybrid (like 2 days in office) may cause more issue. I like this job and besides all this, I have no issue. My POTS are roughly stable. I’m not fainting, I still have little minor episodes that are very fleeting, I could control my diet more at home, but I get better exercise (light walking) in the office. Working an office job has taken a toll on my energy levels; once I’m home, I body shower and I’m beat. I might be able throw something in the oven that’s frozen for dinner, but that’s absolutely it. Working remote would allow me to have better energy. I don’t know.

Apparently I'm toxic slime!?,"Ok. I have a genetic disease that causes tumors to grow at the ends of my nerves, mainly in my spine and brain but the tumors can grow wherever they want to.  I'm 49. I have 2 adult daughters with kids.  I'm deaf. My youngest daughter 24 and a mom of 2 children. She just had her 1st tumor removal surgery and made me aware that I'm toxic.  My mom wasn't the shining example of a mother but at some point I have to say yeah, I know I'm not the best mom. This child of mine is actually a great mom. I knew she would be when she wad a toddler just by how she would treat other kids so i'm not surprised at how well she's doing as a mom. My 27 yr old was diagnosed with O.D.D. as a 8 or 9 year old. She would physically hit me and her younger sister so I asked her where she wanted to live and made it legal.  When my youngest was 10, I took her and left my mom's house.  I was 35. By then I was deaf, I didn't drive but I had to get my 10 yr old out of the unsafe situation.  My mom would team up with my 1st born and they would literally just say and do mean and hurtful things to my youngest and myself.  
      Then 1 day after a year, my mother texted me and said she wad going to give my 1st born over to the state bc she couldn't control her anymore.  So I talked to my bf who actually used to babysit my 1st born when she was a year and a half old and he didn't like seeing me cry, he didn't really like my mom and he wanted to help so I talked to mom and she would not sign custody of her back to me but she'd sign custody over to my bf. Idk what her reasoning was. She's currently dealing with dementia so I can't just say hey,why did you do this? My bf has been dead for about 6 months now and he figured it was a way for mom to say screw you.  Makes total sense! 
     I was recently made aware that I'm a ""toxic"" person and that I shouldn't have had my girls and I'm selfish.   I've Apologized profusely for being a shitty mom.  I can't change the past. I'm sorry their Fathers weren't around growing up but that wasn't up to me. Their dad's made that choice.  I have tried to Apologize for any and everything that I did that was traumatic to them and it's just not good enough. I don't want to lose them but it feels like I might.  I've tried asking them to a face to face meeting and just throw everything out on the table. Get it out and stop holding it in buttbat didn't go over well.  One has totally ignored that topic and the other one doesn't want to go face to face, and that doesn't feel right to me but I'm not going to push it.   What else can I try? I currently live with my oldest daughter and I think both of us have been walking on eggshells but we're being civil.  Both have suggested I go to a nursing home. I don't really want to though.  I'm only 49 and disabled. I'm a huge fall risk buti haven't fallen in 4 months now. Advice would be well received please.  And please be nice,  what would you do with your mom?

What are the hardest parts of depression/depressive episodes for you?,"Hi all, I’m doing a small series on my Instagram about depression.

"Mom had stroke, no clue how to handle SSD/if still able to, help pls? (TLDR at end, wasn’t sure what was necessary to include, sorry)","hi, first time using reddit, sorry if there’s any issues w/ me posting this, but i can’t find any help online. my dad/her husband is no help, and mom is too confused/unmotivated to continue trying to figure this out. we have been struggling a lot financially, with more expenses coming up soon, so i’m trying to see what i can do.

background:  
my mother had a stroke in february, and works in a school system. she had issues with communication and processing, basically all mental, almost no physical symptoms. doctors determined the stroke probably happened due to a small hole in her heart, which she then had a PFO closure surgery in June to fix. she still has some issues, but can generally function how she could before, after all this time and seeing a speech therapist (who my dad told her was okay to stop seeing, bc she didn’t like going to. she was a few points away from the ‘baseline’ still, according to the therapist, but oh well). my mom hadn’t seen a doctor regularly in years, and has only had one appointment w the physician she just got.

i believe she filed FMLA, and i attempted to help her with it, but i do not know for sure what happened/the whole process. anyways.

  
current issue:

i only found out at the end of last month, that short term disability needed to be on our radar. my dad works, and family dynamics arent that great, so he put me in charge of helping my mom ‘figure out what we need to do’. my mom has become incredibly difficult to work with, bc she gets frustrated easily, does not like being told she is wrong/what to do, and doesn’t always understand what she should. eventually, we found we need to ask her doctor to fill out a form for it, called the office, and they told us that she refused to fill out disability forms. my mom is going back to work, and things are going okay so far (though it’s only been a week, and i’ve seen some messages abt her boss needing work things from her. lowkey worried she could get in trouble/demoted/fired from her manager position).

  
TLDR/Question:

is it too late to find some work around, get with another doctor, etc, and receive short term disability pay for the time where she was unable to work while recovering? (mid. February—August) also, maybe any tips for talking abt things like this without making her upset?

I want to help someone get up stairs. ,"I'd like to keep details vague but I'm wondering if I can ask for any insights here.

I try to avoid it, I like my solitude. I know that isn't healthy all the time so I'm working on it but this is one of those ones I don't know how to handle.

Review of Project Relate and Voiceitt: speech-to-text apps for speech differences,"Hey all, I have been trying out accessibility tools for speech disabilities, and figured I’d give an in-depth review of two apps I’ve been trying recently: Project Relate and Voiceitt. I originally wrote this review for r/ headandneckcancer, but figured it may be useful for a broader range of people so reposting it here with mod blessing!

[https://sites.research.google/relate/](https://sites.research.google/relate/)

[https://www.voiceitt.com/](https://www.voiceitt.com/)

Voiceitt and Project Relate are 2 speech-to-text AI platforms aimed at people with speech differences. The basic concept of both tools is you pre-record pre-determined phrases; once you’ve recorded the minimum number, an AI model of your voice is trained and you can start speaking and the AI will be able to transcribe what you’re saying in real-time, to allow you to dictate longer written texts, or to provide captions in real time

TL;DR of the review: I like both of these tools a lot over my current alternatives. Both have strengths and weaknesses, the tech is still relatively new and has a lot of potential. If you think this might help you, I’d recommend giving them a try if you’re able to invest the time in training.

(As a disclaimer: I have a near total glossectomy, so I’m missing functionally all my tongue, and have a fairly significant speech impediment. Most people can understand me with a little effort after about 20 minutes of conversation. I’m a scientist, so I use technical language all the time, and I’m regularly teaching people who aren’t used to my voice. When I first heard about these apps, I wanted them to help conversations one on one, and to use them as subtitles when presenting. I also don’t have any other disabilities. Also, when I was trying them out I wasn’t planning to write a review so this might not be completely comprehensive, and it is my opinion. Your mileage may vary!)

# Set up and training:

First off, Project Relate is currently only available on Android as an app. It’s in beta at the moment. Voiceitt, (or Voiceitt2, specifically) on the other hand, is a web app, so can be accessed on multiple devices, but it’s dependent on an internet connection. Project Relate is free as of writing, Voiceitt has a free trial period, but then charges monthly.

I found both very easy and simple to set up, with clear instructions and big buttons. PR can just be downloaded from the app store, whereas I had to email the local distributor (Adapt-it, in the UK) of Voiceitt to get an account, but that was no hassle. Both offer a mode for if someone is helping you set it up. Voiceitt also offers additional accessibility tools which I didn’t personally explore.

I won’t lie to you: training takes a while and is boring. Voiceitt requires a minimum of 200 phrases. PR says they need 500, but generated my first model after around 300. In both cases, this took me around 3 hours cumulatively. You can take as long to record these as you like, so if you can only record 20 or 5 phrases a day or whatever that’s no big deal. You can skip any phrases that you don’t want to record, and both apps can “say” the phrase before you say it. Voiceitt has a maximum timer on how long you can take to say a phrase, which for some phrases felt short for me.

Once you’ve trained the minimum, both apps let you record custom phrases. That’s great for teaching things like people’s names, locations, or specific vocabulary. This has been a game changer for me at reception desks for hospital appointments, but also at work. Project Relate lets you have letters, numbers, and basic punctuation in these custom phrases, so you can teach it your address, while Voiceitt only allows letters. Voiceitt offers a shortcut phrase, where you could say a short phrase, and it will write out a longer message - very cool.

The minimum is just a minimum, the more you train, the better it works. And this will be variable based on your specific speech. After 700 phrases, PR still says its understanding of my voice is “medium”. But I find that’s fine for occasional use!

# Using the AI:

Once you’re all trained up, you can start using the AI. You can either speak, and the AI will write it down, or you can speak, and the AI will repeat it out loud. Voiceitt also splits up its functionality into a conversation mode and a dictation mode. The conversation mode is for shorter phrases, dictation is for longer speaking.

PR seems to process the audio word by word, popping up immediately after you speak. Voiceitt seems to wait for you to finish a phrase or sentence before transcribing, but in my experience that often makes it more accurate, just slightly slower. Both apps do better with shorter phrases and frequent pauses, so struggle more the longer I speak uninterrupted. Both apps make mistakes fairly regularly, but that will improve as I train more phrases.

I found the Voiceitt conversation mode only really worked for really short sentences - it would split my sentence onto 2 screens, which wasn’t very helpful for me, so I mostly used the dictate mode. Both coped well with most of the technical phrases that I taught them. I never really tried the options where the AI repeated what it thought I said out loud, but I could see that being a function appealing to some people.

Voiceitt also offers a function where the text is flipped upside down so that you can have the phone flat in front of you and the other person can read, which I thought was neat.

What I wanted from both apps was the ability to change font size, so that I could make the text bigger if someone is further away from me (or for accessibility reasons!). This is something the “Speech Assistant” text-to-speech app I use does very well, and I miss it in these.

Both AIs struggled if there was background noise: other conversations nearby, wind, music or being in a vehicle all posed additional challenges, so in those situations, I used alternative tools.

# Additional Functions:

Along with what I would call the “Core function” of being able to dictate in the app and have the app write a live transcript, both tools offer additional functions:

**Transcription outside the app:** Voiceitt has a Chrome extension that you can use on other webpages, so you could use it to dictate emails or write on forums, etc. Project Relate has the Relate Keyboard which you can use to dictate in other apps on your Android device. This is incredible if you also have challenges typing (fatigue, motor disabilities, etc), but I didn’t try this out.

**Smart Assistants:** PR lets you speak to Google Assistant, on your phone, so you can ask it the weather, set a timer, etc. I don’t think at this moment it integrates with Google Home devices, but I haven’t tried. Voiceitt doesn’t, but its website points out that by having the app repeat what you said out loud, it can help you speak to your smart home devices. (Presumably also true for PR) This is something I’ll play with more in the future because I used to love having my silly voice-controlled lights, and I can see it being a game changer if you have a disability that affects your mobility.

**Integration with Video Call Apps:** Voiceitt, through Webex, offers integration with video call apps like Microsoft teams and Zoom. I didn’t try this because my job is entirely in-person, and I very rarely have video meetings, but if in the future that changes, this would be one of the most important features for me. It functions that there would be a pop-up in the video call where people could read the transcription as you speak, same as if you were holding your phone up in person. This does come with an additional cost.

# Additional Comments and Verdict:

Both services worked well for me. The alternative for me is that on the occasions when people are struggling to understand me, I often have to pause and write it down. Just having the live transcription there has made those conversations much more fluid. Both apps do make mistakes, that will improve as I train them more, but the feedback I receive from people speaking with me is that even when the app is wrong, it provides more of a hint of what I am saying. And I found people became used to my voice faster so we stopped needing aids sooner or as often in the conversation.

There are situations where both apps struggle. I tried to use Voiceitt as a tool recently when I was presenting in a large group meeting with a slide deck. Because the Voiceitt app took up part of the screen space separate to the slide deck, the feedback was that there was too much happening on my screen. Because both apps struggle more with long uninterrupted speech, they make more mistakes. This will only improve as the technology improves. I would love to see integration in the future where the dictation looks more like movie subtitles under my slide deck. But for conversations in quiet places with people who aren’t used to my voice, both have been immeasurably valuable.

Customer support, when I contacted both teams, was thorough and efficient. Voiceitt’s distributors also offer additional support if you need it. In the spirit of Nothing About Us Without Us, both have had staff with speech differences involved in the project. Both have speech therapy experts involved.

Voiceitt is subscription-based, so there is a cost there. But paying for this would likely fall under “reasonable accommodations” at work and school, and there are grants in many places to support paying for this type of technology.

For myself, I’ve chosen to stick with Project Relate for now. I’m keeping a close eye on Voiceitt to see what new features it offers, and if I ever swap to a job that has frequent video call meetings, I’ll probably go back to Voiceitt. I see incredible potential in this technology, and it is still relatively new. It will only improve in the next few years. If you’re up for the long training process, I think both are worth a shot.

Let me know if you have any questions about either!",1,1eqqijv,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eqqijv/review_of_project_relate_and_voiceitt/,0,1723499625.0

Accommodations at home,"Hi all,
Has anyone been through a similar situation?

I live in a building that receives money from the fed gov (in the us) to house disabled and older folks.

The entry way is a beast to get in and out of and many folks can't leave their apartment without help due to the door.

I'm a person who can't get in without help and have gone through the process of accommodations in the state of Maryland. I think they are letting it stall out, trying to slowly collect 6 different quotes.. (in an area where the number of contractors is small). It's been years and many different people have filed about the lack of accessible entry. It's kind of horrific to even type out. Folks have died of depression complications from not being able to get out on their own for sunshine etc, all because of the door to the building. 

Is there a time line where the request dies if certain steps don't manifest? Do I have to find out and ride their asses?

Looking into legal help but if anyone knows the best practices for accommodations guidelines or how to easily access... cognition for digging up info and reading comprehension are not happening anymore. I'd like to get an idea of what kinds of info might be useful to their potential arguments. I'm sorry if I'm a nube with some of these woes and still feel this but damn does anyone else feel so damn tired of having it be a shock to folks at a disabled housing institution (or similar) that we are indeed disabled. There's a soft gas lighting and it's supremely bone chillingly spiritually exhausting to me anywho.

How do you receive assistance for a non-visible disability at an airport?,"I'm autistic and have EDS and a bunch of other untreated physical issues that cause me to be easily confused and exhausted. I've gone through airports a couple times and it has always been hell, I'm in an extreme amount of pain from the walking, I am rushed through security faster than I can manage my luggage, i struggle to make it through the aisle or stow my carry-on, and other passengers and airport assistants are constantly rude to me because it takes me longer to do things than the average person and i don't pick up on things that are obvious to everyone else like instructions and signs.

i really think I would benefit from disability assistance or pre-boarding, but anytime I try to actually mention Im disabled to someone at the airport, they get really confrontational with me which destroys the little emotional energy i have to get through the procedure at all.

I've been told by a couple people to ""just go up and ask them,"" and I genuinely have tried, but they are always rude to me and turn me away/treat me like a lost child telling me to just go to my gate. i only ever get assistance when I'm visibly on the verge of collapsing and someone notices and offers to help.

"Does anyone else get ""voluntold"" to do things because they don't have a day job?","I'm annoyed that there are some people who think my free time is their free time to use. I will get asked or told to do things (for free, with no reward) for other people. They often get hostile if I refuse. They may want me to organize something, or research something for them online. Sometimes I get asked to make art for something (I have some specific creative talents) all for free. I do my best to say no to most of these requests unless it is somebody who is offering something in return, or if they have done similarly difficult or time consuming tasks for me. I just get really annoyed that there are so many people that think my not having a job means I have any extra free time. I spend a good portion of my day just trying to care for myself. Cooking is difficult and time consuming, bathing is difficult and time consuming, keeping up with physical therapy is necessary and time consuming. At the end of it all I see people with regular jobs have more time and energy for leisure than I do on a good day, and then they want to take away my free time to use for themselves.

Nonprofit idea - Free outdoor mobility aid rental,"I used to live a very active life before ME/CFS and POTS changed my life a few years ago. I stopped everything, working, outdoors, travel, because I had no choice. I have been blessed to go from severe to moderate ME and can work a few hours per week and go outdoors with aids. I recently have acquired some incredible mobility devices (electric off road trike, and lightweight foldable TSA travel power chair) that have allowed me to have experiences outdoors again. I would like to find a way to share these experiences with my disabled community. 

My current idea is starting an organization that allows local vetted members rent my equipment, and acquire more equipment, free of charge. I’ve been thinking a lot about the logistics and details, but I wanted to ask the community a few general questions to see if this would actually be useful. 

1. I am blessed to live with “only” moderate  ME currently. And want to enjoy the outdoors, but require mobility aids to do so. Are there enough people like me? Or are most more severe (can’t go outdoors), and or less severe (don’t need aids to manage outdoors). 

2. Is renting (picking up and dropping off) these big mobility aids too much work for our community, meaning it wouldn’t be used?

3. Is this helpful at all? Have you ever wanted to get outdoors but not had the funds to acquire the aids? Would these aids get you outdoors? All the aids I’m envisioning are beyond insurance coverage. 

4. What else would be helpful? What is preventing you from travel or from getting outdoors? Do you want to be outdoors? Would this be useful?

5. Any feedback is appreciated.

Received Medicare how to proceed forward?,"30 something/m, Pennsylvania  
  
Not sure what to include or not, but I have no idea what to do going forward, but know that I need to move forward.

  
Allergic reaction to infant vaccine at birth, suspected cognitive issues, wasn't able to see until long after the statue of limitations ran out(the passivity side effect is a factor in me being a recluse. A big win was two years or so ago some shady person asked for my ID for the cellphone buyback machine. First instinct was to go ""sure"", but was able to override it. severe problems with some maths, and logical/mathematic issues, difficulty engaging in complex tasks and etc. Sometimes when I type, sentences are messed up, with the beginning in the end or the end in the begging, or worse, whole parts of the sentence are radically different then what I wanted to type, or words would be different. Didn't become an issue until after I learned to type the proper way.).

Still dealing with trauma from toddler/childhood and etc. The worst was when my mom was seriously considering divorce when I was around 4-ish, landlord she called, called back at the worst time(when dad, siblings and me were in the house), so he did the ""perfectly rational thing""/sarc for holding a four year old against a wall and engage in a horrific interrogation. My memories of it are in the third person. Probably spent most of my life outright trapped in a fluctuating weird mental state, that I still find myself slipping into. 

2nd Grade, never had homework, and because of the prior mentioned event, when I was at school I could not remember home, when I was at home couldn't remember school. Teacher frustrated over ""homework""(legit didn't know the meaning of the word back then) would physically assault me, verbally assault me, and got the rest of the class to join in, kicking me deeper down in self imprisonment.    


Towards the end of the year, my psyche/soul/mind fractured? After classmates took the bullying to the playground, I didn't understand what was going on, because playground memories segregated from classroom memories, and was simply unaware, even though I felt the emotional wounds from it all. I tried to find the words for how evil they were, as the word ""evil"" seemed lacking, and could not even the find the words to describe how I felt. While staring at the sky, after failing to find the words, I felt starting in my head, like halfway through my right eye, from top of head down to my feet, begin to break away.

As it was about to break away completely, I felt/heard it howling, and in my heart I howled with it, and the process stopped. Below my heart melted back into me, at my heart I felt it intertwine with me? It was a powerful force throughout much of my life, but more recently is silent as long as I acknowledge data/feelings from it. When I don't, it is unruly.

Add in more trauma and stuff throughout teens years, I kind of failed at life. Extreme recluse, probably a schizoid or something(never drove more then 40-60 miles from home alone, only associate with my mom who I live with, nieces and nephews and siblings who live nearby. Extreme to mild aversion to relatives who looked the other way while dad was abusive/negligent.).

Beyond that, mild back issues due to injury during my late teens. After catching covid three times, developed some problems I was able to treat, but persistent heel problems in both heels. On a good to average day, nothing wrong. If I over exert myself, mild to severe pain that causes me to require a walker to get around the house. During lockdowns, did some supplement therapies for the lolz, and it had a profound effect, when I reached a certain tipping point, my brain reset and my life flashed before my eyes off and on for a few months and my memory became more unified.

Recently, I qualified for and received Medicare benefits. The problem is, I don't know what to do next, and the whole thing fills me with dread and terror when I think about it.  It's like seeing a building in the distance, walking up to it and not only not able to find the doorway, but filled with intense anxiety about walking into the building. 

How can I use my benefits to achieve the best possible increase to quality of life? SSI is one route, but it is all so overwhelming.

Just had a bad experience in the bathroom today. ,"So I was at the movies with my little brother I had to pee really bad and told him I needed to go, he told me he wasn’t going into the women bathroom so I said that’s fine I can go into the men’s since we’re in the middle of the movies so no one should be in there so he took me.  

Well I noticed there was a little boy just hovering around the bathroom area, he was the only person in the hall so my brother went in and put me on the toilet, he held the door shut for me (Because the bathroom there is not handicap accessible at ALL) I take forever because I can’t use my legs as well, there’s no rails, no nothing and then I see tiny little feet run up to the door and then a banging sound, I see my brother hand grip tighter to the top of the door and heard him say someone was in there. 

The little boy told him to let go of the door because he had to use the bathroom, my brother said there was a urinal I assumed he had to go number two so I was trying to hurry, then I hear my brother say “you do not have to hit me, please just wait.” My brother has the patience of a saint because then as I’m looking down this little boy kicks my brother in his knee and caught my brother off guard, halfway opened the toilet and my brother proceeded to completely stand in front of the door, my brother tells him to stop being a little shit, he did cuss at him I won’t lie there but then the boy lets out this high pitched scream and stomps his way out the bathroom.

Like the little boy escalated so quickly to put his hands on someone he ain’t ever met before, my brother tells me to hurry up and I was finally able to go pee but then as I’m getting my pants up the little boy comes back in with another man who was his dad, I hear “This is who you were talking about?” Which is never a good sign to hear coming from a parent so then automatically this man raises his voice saying why are refusing him to let his son use the bathroom, my brother was mumbling and said because someone is trying to use the bathroom now the man went “Huh?!” Then said “Speak up, boy ain’t no one can understand a damn thing you say” 

My brother kept saying someone was in there and the man is only getting louder like the situation escalated as fast as his son except this was a grown man so now the situation got scary for real, I yelled from the other side apologizing and saying im almost done, this makes the dad mad at me and told me a woman had no business being in the men bathroom and he was going to call the cops if I didn’t hurry up and get out, I was able to get my pants up quick enough as he was saying this so I said “Okay I’m done” and told my brother to get me, my brother opens the door, unfolds my wheelchair and pulls it out.

So my first look at this man, this man looked like a heavy user which I’m going to leave it at that because I didn’t know why the man was so pissed off but now I knew why but I don’t know what he was thinking but when my brother slammed open that wheelchair I heard him go “Oh” And I apologized, I told him I can’t use the bathroom by myself but the Dad apologized and told me that he was so sorry and he didn’t see a wheelchair, no joke this man tries to crack a little joke afterwards saying how it was so small he didn’t see it and I bet I’m glad it could fold up like that, I didn’t laugh but my brother awkwardly laughs and quickly got me out of the bathroom, we didn’t even stay for the movie we just decided to go home after that.

Anyone else with BLE lymphedema?,"Four years ago I was diagnosed with BLE lymphedema which is relatively rare compared to other forms of lymphedema, which are usually caused by cancer or cancer treatment and affect only one limb. I have had a really bad flare up recently and it’s really making me upset.

I also have a trip coming up where I’ll have to do a lot of walking, and I’m really scared I’m going to need a lot of breaks to be able to make it through it. I have some vascular scans coming up after my trip to double check that my issues aren’t due to venous insufficiency but last time I had them done my veins were fine. Between my diagnosis and today, I had like two years of relatively low symptoms, because I had lost a lot of weight. I gained weight about a half year ago because I got put on a lot of new meds at once and my doctors and I are slowly trying to figure out which one is causing the weight gain and I really hope that losing weight again will help with the symptoms because I’m in so much pain every day that I have to move from my bed.

Airline said they’ll ’pray for me’,"I’m really upset by an interaction I just had with British Airways and I really just need to let it out to people who understand. I am 29 and have arthritis in my spine, so really limited mobility and constant pain. It took me 4 years to be taken seriously and to see a neurosurgeon because I’m ’too young to be in this much pain’ so I don’t know if I’m just sensitive to this kind of comment but it feels really inappropriate. 

I’ve got return flights to Nashville from London in September - when I found out my spine was only going to get worse, me and my (now) Wife cancelled our fancy wedding, went to the registry office and booked a once in a lifetime bucket list trip. I’ve requested disability assistance to help with luggage and boarding the plane in both directions. When I booked this, the BA rep told me that because I’m disabled I don’t have to pay the fee to reserve a seat which I was so grateful for as I’ve recently had to stop working. 

So today I rang up to reserve seats for the way back and the guy said 
“Just because you’ve requested support doesn’t mean you deserve a free seat, what’s actually wrong with you?” 
I told him about my condition and he sat and googled it and said 
“wow, that does sound awful, I’ll pray for you.” 

I find it quite triggering when people say things like that anyway because it makes me feel like they’re acknowledging my life is shit and needs praying for. My condition isn’t going to get better and I’m trying every damn day to live life to the fullest, your prayers can’t do anything. 

But I think just the accusatory tone from this guy, after recently having to go through the process of getting PIP and a blue badge and justifying my existence has just really struck a nerve. 

I don’t know, maybe I’m overreacting but I’m really upset and it just feels really inappropriate that he had to google my condition to see if I was worthy of support? ",235,1eosc65,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eosc65/airline_said_theyll_pray_for_me/,42,1723294404.0

"I suffer with extreme IBS, Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Attacks, Severe Anxiety, Fatigue, Zero Energy, Memory Loss, Insomnia. ","I've suffered from constipation since I was a tween. So I tried the high fiber, exercising, Metamucil, laxatives, EVERYTHING.  I am in complete discomfort every day, every single day. I have went over 2 weeks without a movement. This CANNOT be healthy. All these toxins in my body.
Dealing with this for 30 years. Eventually I started using saline enemas about once a week, but they never completely empty my bowels. They did seem to be my best option. 
When I do poop, they are rock hard & like gumball sized. As I've gotten older, especially in the last few years it's gotten so severe that I'm in constant pain... Like can't move laying in fetal position sometimes in tears. I can literally feel the solid rock turds moving through my intestines. Especially when what used to be rounded, started probably compacting so much that they have sharp edges. 
They only way I can explain it is that it feels like Freddie Kruger is in my stomach slowly moving & ripping my insides! It's excruciating! The enemas don't seem to go up far enough to empty so the slight relief is only short lived. 
My doctor doesn't seen to understand the severity of this all. I finally urged him to send me to a specialist. So I had a colonoscopy up the rear & down the throat & was excited hoping they could find some fixable blockage or something. 
My results showed that I have a healthy ""twisty bowel"". So great this has plagued my entire life & now it's gotten so bad I rarely leave the house. 
So doctor finally prescribed me Linzess & I was hopeful... took it a month & within first week I feel pain 85% of my life. Bloated, gas, the rocks that inhabit my insides. I have shit myself multiple times a day for weeks. Just out of nowhere. It's like oily green & just a small amount each time. I'm terrified to even leave the house. I've gotta go back to work & I'm terrified! I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE. It's debilitating. Embarrassing. Idk what else to do. 
I made an appointment with another GI & all they have is a video chat appointment!
Like what in the world is that going to do? I've thought maybe a stool sample? 
I live in Greenville area South Carolina.
Anyone that has any suggestions please enlighten me! I'm now 43 & the thought that I'm only middle aged & may have to just live in this agony & constant anxiety isn't ok.

Disability help,"Hello! I’m new to Reddit, and I downloaded it because I’m hoping that I can find someone who can help me figure out what’s wrong with me. I have tried time and time again to try and get a professional opinion or diagnosis, but they all just pass it off as “growing pain”. I know, and I’ve always known that’s not what it is. Before I get any further let me just explain what my symptoms are.

Aches and pains in my leg bones, specifically in the knees, ankles, and hips of both of my legs.

Pain best described as something inside my bones eating away at them.

Pain is worse in left leg and can literally travel through my leg from area to area and even leg to leg.

Hip and thigh muscles are tender almost all the time.

 Pain seems to flair up worst when I’m having an anxiety attack.

I’m in pain every day non stop if I don’t take medicine, and if I do take medicine it usually goes away for a day or two and then comes back not long afterwards.

Pain can vary in severity but is usually around a 5/10 or higher. 



It’s been like this pretty much my entire life, but when I was younger my legs used to also lock up sometimes but don’t at the moment. When I wear compression socks it helps a little I think, taking pain medicine used to help it go away but now it only does sometimes, and only certain medicines help at all. Increased physical activity can make it flair up but not always, when I’m on my legs during the pain it feels like more of a ache, and when I’m off it it’s more of a throbbing ache if that makes sense? I’ve been thinking about possibly trying out a mobility aid like a cane or something but I doubt I could get my hands on one… I’ve done some research and I can’t seem to find anything that matches my symptoms, and I also know it’s not growing pain like the doctors say because I’ve done my research on that too and it’s definitely just not it 💀

Well, now that I’ve explained all I can think of right now, I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts on the matter, especially if you have an idea of what might be wrong? ",2,1epcdmn,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1epcdmn/disability_help/,7,1723351325.0

How to tell Family I'm getting a wheelchair?,"So I've been struggling with mobility a lot lately. In may 2023 my L5 slipped and I started getting numbness in my legs, in july it became so bad that I had to opt for surgery. The right leg was mostly ok after the surgery but apparently the left legs nerves were damaged too much and I've had problems with numbness and chronic pain in it ever since.

I'm currently on crutches, but I can't go out for anything more than 1 hour if I can't rest/lie down. I get horrible nerve pain and it's hard to move with a leg I can't completely feel/control.

I've talked to my doctors about it and they agreed that an ambulatory wheelchair would be a good idea, so I can get out more. I already have a prescription and if everything works out with insurance I should get the chair in 2-3 weeks.

Now for the problem: I haven't told my family about it. I want to be sure that I actually have the wheelchair first, so that they can't talk me out of it. I have no idea how to tell my family about this. They have tried to be supportive about my disability, but they don't understand just how bad it can get. When I first mentioned a wheelchair as a possible option, the answer I got was basically ""No you don't need that, it's not that bad yet"". 

I think they're having trouble coming to terms with the fact that I'm disabled because they desperately want me to be okay (especially my mom). But it ends up making me feel like shit and makes my imposter syndrome worse.

How do I explain that a wheelchair isn't a bad thing, but something that could give me a little freedom back? How do I explain why I haven't told them about it earlier?

Should I file for disability?,"This may be long - 

Back in May 2022 when I was 27 i went into sudden cardiac arrest (STEMI) while driving - I had left work not feeling well and was planning on going home to take a nap. For context later, I am a full time single custodial father of a young boy. 

I went unconscious and crashed my car into a pole on the other side of the median (crossing oncoming lanes) and luckily had an off duty firefighter (same age) driving behind me who injured himself getting me out and then performing manual CPR for 80 minutes before getting a pulse back. This extended downtime causes a severe Anoxic Brain Injury that i was not expected to recover from, mentally, however, I have recovered exponentially against all odds. 

 I spent 6 weeks in the hospital with 2 of those on life support in an induced coma. Besides the ABI, I also suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury from hitting my head. 

After leaving the hospital i spent the following 10 months living with family and going to countless appointments. Cardiac, speech therapy, physical therapy, etc. 

I was off work for about a year from a company I spent the entirety of my 20s building a career at, to return after a year of involuntary medical leave to get demoted and my pay cut severely. I ended up leaving the company because of this and have found it hard to make the same kind of money i was making pre-accident. 

Against all odds im currently delivering packages for Amazon which is highly physical and is taking a toll on my Boston Sci Heart Logic Score, but im feeling physically fine and full of energy every day. 

During the year off work I also was required by doctors to live with family members until cleared for the brain injuries, I had to pay for an maintain my empty house this entire time with no income besides the measly $18k of lost wages i was able to squeeze out of the insurance company.

My question is, should i continue busting my ass for Amazon full time, or should i file for full disability in Michigan and find a part time job to maintain that. 

Would it be worth the payments and living a little longer or will i just become more and more in debt? Im still working on all of the debt i accrued during my year healing. Credit cards loans etc that havnt been paid yet.

He has issues with his legs, involving strength and control (his leg may not move the way he wants it to), his lower back, his neck, and his arms. About 8 years ago he needed a surgery on his neck which resulted in him losing a lot of strength and function in his arms and hands.

Some days are better than others, but he's not getting any better, and it really bothers him that he's so reliant on others. I was hoping you may have some advice or some ideas of ways he can do things on his own, or products you or someone you know use to make things easier.

I got my dad a sandwich maker a few years ago so he could make grilled cheese on his own, with minimal fire risk, as he can't always make it up the stairs to use the stove, and even if he could he's afraid to start a fire when no one's home.

My biggest concern is cooking. We're not always home, and as it starts to get colder as the year closes, he's going to want ways to make warm food.

While we have a microwave for him, he can't always move well enough to make it over there, and he's a afraid he might drop the hot food and burn himself.

While him eating is my biggest concern, any and all tips or recommendations you may have would be amazing. I love my dad and I want the best for him.

Thank you all so much",11,1eoy921,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eoy921/how_to_help_someone_with_a_disability_keep_as/,8,1723310192.0

Issues with new boss and my accommodations - do I report?,"Background: I (34F) have approved accommodations for my ADHD, including flexible hours in office and up to 10 WFH days a month to use at my discretion. I average ~6 ever since my company went zero to sixty on the return to office at the start of this year. I have some helpful accommodations for in office, but it’s an open office and people are not always mindful of their volume or booking a conference room for a zoom call (a rant for another time). Therefore I am much more productive at home on most days. I had no issues - my former boss “J” was very understanding and even encouraging when it came to my accommodations knowing it was a win-win.

Two months ago my department was reorg-ed under a new Chief officer “L” who recently joined the company. She’s been ruffling lots of feathers and unfortunately my boss is leaving the company at the end of August so now I’m reporting directly to her. There have been some specific instances:

- prior to the reporting change L made some comments about my hours in office, which I wrote off tbh

- J advised L that I had an accommodation. Apparently her response was “that’s excessive amount of wfh days and unnecessary.” 

- J and I both met with L one day when I asked how J’s scope would be covered since I couldn’t take it all on indefinitely. She responded with something along the lines of “we’re all going to have to work a little more” followed by humble bragging about working late nights and weekends, and “I wish I could work from home, you know, sleep in and do almost nothing but that’s not how things are going work.”

- I requested two days of PTO for my brothers wedding and received an email from her “were you aware that you scheduled vacation during a visit from the executive chair” (A. we have unlimited PTO, B. there’s no expectation or communication of my involvement with this visit)

I’m thinking that a few of these have crossed the line and I need to at least document with HR that I’m feeling uncomfortable and pressure from my supervisor with regard to my accommodations. But I haven’t dealt with this before so any advice is appreciated 🙏🏼",0,1epcd5f,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1epcd5f/issues_with_new_boss_and_my_accommodations_do_i/,4,1723351274.0

Why aren’t ’entry-level’ jobs accessible AT ALL???,"I’m so goddamn tired. It’s so baffling being told there are better candidates for a part-time remote
job that pays in packing peanuts, and that I’m stupid for even trying to apply without experience. No, not experience that’s completely relative to the position, because I wasn’t employed in that time, so it doesn’t count. I’m young, I’m housebound.. I don’t know what the hell else to do. People say ‘just get a caseworker to help you find an entry-level job’, and I don’t have the time, health, or mobility for it!

i feel like my mom believes me one second and then doesn't the next,"something that's getting to me really bad. I've been struggling really really bad with imposter syndrome about not feeling sick enough or disabled enough despite not even being able to apply to jobs anymore without hurting myself severely, but have made good progress in the last 3 months I've been away from family visiting my partner's family.

one day she'll say me not having it as bad as others doesn't mean I'm undeserving or not disabled, and the next she tells me about one of her friends with a worse/physical condition got denied.

I'm going home today, just to find out she helped my sister (autism and depression) while I was gone but never once offered to help me despite how hard my memory and emotional problems have made it for me. i could barely fill out the paperwork myself and definitely got my work history wrong due to memory loss from my diagnoses. I had to get her to help but still got it wrong.

I feel very overdramatic saying this, but I honestly feel like it's either disability or I kill myself. even when I was working I was slowly killing myself through an ED and self harm. I can't even apply to jobs anymore afte having an extremely traumatic 2021 (family member death, getting kicked out of my life long home/state, getting abused by 2 jobs and losing them, psychiatric hospitalization, getting threatened by a family member, etc).

I just black out and self harm. I wanted to so, so badly and was excited to work again. my ptsd has gotten to a level that I cannot cope and have not been able to in 2 years. I spend more time in flashbacks/dissociation than I do otherwise. keeping myself safe feels like 3 full time jobs.

one day she supports me, and the next she is comparing me to her friends with physical disabilities like me having mental disabilities is less serious. even worse when she compares me to her ""successful friend with DID""

How to deal with people misapplying learned helplessness theory in ableist ways? ,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness?wprov=sfla1

For one, learned helplessness applies to mental illnesses like depression, so applying it to other things is outside of the original scope. 

An ongoing example of this in my life is me struggling in seeking out getting a wheelchair to be an ambulatory wheelchair user. 

When I first brought this up in 2021 to an OT when I was in hospital, I was told no OT would ever recommend me a wheelchair while I had any ability to walk because ""you might just get so used to being in a wheelchair you won't want to walk anymore."" 

I've had it as a vague goal since then, but haven't been able to put effort into finding an open minded OT yet etc. Recently I was talking about looking for a job with my support worker and said ""well, any job I apply for would have to be done by someone in a wheelchair"" and she said, ""what, are up wanting to become a wheelchair user or something?"" 

No Carol, I want to be able to work. I want to be able to go out on a zoo day. I want to be able to travel safely on public transport & go on outings with my family. 

A wheelchair would let me do things I can't now. It's not limiting me, it's giving me *more* freedom. 

Plus I want a self propelling wheelchair so I wouldn't be at risk of all my muscles getting ""deconditioned"" anyway, which is the other excuse they use. (Just prescribe some exercise to mitigate that if you need to Drs, that's not a good excuse to deny supports.)

Anyway, how do you respond to people denying supports because ""you'll get used to them and lose your independence"" or whatever? ",72,1eogc6f,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eogc6f/how_to_deal_with_people_misapplying_learned/,23,1723251572.0
Exahusting DAS Interview,"TLDR: Denied DAS after having to explain myself to three different people on the call.  
I just have to vent somewhere.  
I am so emotionally exhausted after having my DAS interview for WDW. 

I have a host of issues, most importantly for this anxiety & autism. I 1st spoke with a regular CM, then a 'healthcare' partner, and then their neurologist. They did not share any information and I had to re-explain myself every single time. I was sobbing by the end of it. They kept saying, ""It's okay, this isn't a test."" As if that was the problem. As is it doesn't take everything out of me to push past my insecurities and social anxiety to talk to them at all let alone divulge all of my medical history which hardly seems reasonable. And is if talking about my panic and anxiety isn't a trigger. 

They also start with ""What do you want me to know?"" which is such a non question and incredibly confusing. All three of them said it. 

I knew there was a good chance I'd get denied with all of the changes but I really didn't think I'd have to repeat myself in this way over and over again. It was humiliating. I can't imagine being one of the CMs who has to sit there and listen to this all day. It was horrible.

"Why are people so concerned with me ""identifying as disabled""? I'm struggling with where to draw the line. Or if there even is a line. ","My therapist has ""said this for awhile"" apparently. I just completed a program for FND and they wanted to make sure that I don't ""identify as being disabled"". 

I have to censor myself when I talk to people. I also have to ""bring my worst day"" when filling out paperwork or going to the doctor. So when I use words like ""I cant"" it's because I'm trying to explain my limitations to able bodied people. I say I'm disabled 
Because it's true
It's had to become a part of my identity right? I have BPD so I often don't know what identity may mean. Being disabled isn't the first thing I'd use to describe myself. But it's definitely the first thing people see. 

I am not neurotypical. I have trauma brain. No chance at having a chance. Just survival. I don't identify as being neurodivergent. I don't accept the various diagnoses because the symptoms are what I can address. But so frequently my literal inability to do something is invalidated or ignored.

I'm offended by this opinion. It feels shameful. Like it's not okay to identify as being disabled. It feels bad. So maybe you guys can help me understand it better?  Is my setting up a disability support group an issue?  Where does it end? I'm so sad right now.

One single source of truth: is it not possible to consolidate all health and medical information to OHIP so that one does not have to repeat that information over and over to every single service agency.,"I want to raise the inefficiencies in government when dealing with persons with disabilities. This may also serve other communities but for now my grievances are with the need for every government funded organization to ask the same questions over and over. Canadian privacy legislation requires that personal information be collected for the purpose of job - to identify someone or make a determination.  In the case of all these organizations they should require a GC key and access to the OHIP card to get information to determine one’s eligibility for services. For example, if you qualify for DSO, CMHA, Passport, Surrey Place, etc… that information should align to OHIP basic bio information. Then all you would need to do is present your OHIP card for the next service you need to determine eligibility. Why would this not work or can it work?

It’s strange how your life can change so much,"I’ve been thinking about how I have a condition that could make me go blind, and how I nearly had to get hearing aids for life as a child. 

When I was a child, I had fluid building up in my ears and needed tubes in my ears twice. The ENT told my mom that if he found a fluid buildup after the second time I had tubes… I’d have to deal with the fluid and wear hearing aids for life. 

And now, for the condition that has a chance at making me blind, it’s IIH, or Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension. 

As I’m thinking about it, something that you don’t even know about could just… sneak up on you and take one of your senses, or at least mess them up.

Concerns about finances,"Apologies as I am able-bodied, but I thought this may be the best place to ask this question. Any advice or input is very much appreciated! 

I have two partners, both who live separately in a different state, but very close together, E (23NB) and J (22M). J and I are both able to work, though we struggle with some mental health. E is disabled, primarily EDS but also struggles with CPTSD from childhood and autism.

The plan is for them to move in with me once I am able to purchase my passed grandparents' house. However, E has been denied disability twice, just applied the third time, and due to their age and the general lack of knowledge around EDS, we're pretty sure it'll have to go to a lawyer and court.

J and I are planning to work to be able to support all three of us. While E struggles with wanting to work but not being able to, we have no issues with supporting them financially.

My question/concern is that I don't want E to feel like we're their parents financially. Once they learn how to handle money more responsibly (they were never taught how and ADHD likes impulse spending), I would love for them to be able to handle some finances (they want to cook and bake, so maybe groceries), but I don't have a good way of doing that. I've seen on Google that an ""allowance"" is a good idea in this case, but I felt that may be condescending? I'm not sure. I work in construction, so my income fluctuates with mother nature, and I'm not sure how to set a good number if we did try any allowance.

Backpay flagged as assets,"Hello! I just wanted to ask a question regarding a backpay issue I'm currently having.

  
I'm getting 3 or 4 backpay installments from the SSA for the time that I was appealing to get on disability. Each installment pushes me over the $2,000 limit even if I have no money in my account, but I was assured by workers, and in letters, that these installments would not count for 9 months (I am currently on month 6 of the first installment)

But now the SSA is sending me letters saying that I've been over the entire year, and that they will be stopping my monthly payments and 'requesting' money back. 

  
I should have never been counted as over, if I had never gotten my backpay installment I would have been below the limit. And I spend all I can of my check every month before sending the leftovers to my ABLE Now account before the month ends. (For context, I had $1,200 before I got disability, and my check is $628 a month. So at most I can only be in the $1800's, and could only go over that if I kept money from my monthly checks, but I don't)

  
I'm going to be filling out an appeal today over this, because I'm sure its just a computer error. But is there anything else I need to do? Do I need to call anyone or schedule and appointment to talk in person about this?

Dressing More Independently ,"Hello, I would just like y’all’s advice on dressing more independently.

Belts

Necklaces 

Bracelets on my left arm

My letter requesting an accommodations appeal,"For some quick context my employer granted my wfh accommodations last September but randomly denied it 6 months in claiming nonsense when my supervisor in a recorded training told me how my coworkers complaining about my accommodations was the sole reason for my denial. I told my employer this is illegal after speaking with the EEOC a ton of times with my employer telling me they can do what they want and that my supervisor misspoke… he told me this over many conversations so there might be a bigger problem if he misspoke that many times. 2 of the reasons for denial was some short project I completed within a week with one of them being moving medical charts solely to put a lounge in our tiny spider infested office that has about 10 people working out of it.

I do want to include that I was told by my hiring director that I am a personality hire and my employer has made it very clear over the last year that they desire my fun and infectious in office presence which is somewhat flattering but none of these reasons should determine that my health is not important. My most recent accommodations meeting the HR person was smug asking me invasive medical questions trying to catch me being able bodied which is why I included that last part that seemed a bit aggressive.

I don’t talk all corporate/professional and always share what’s on my mind with my employer so please excuse the informal tone. Do you think I checkmated them with this email? Whether they approve me or not I’m definitely taking legal action for denying my accommodations under false pretenses and forcing me to come in office for 6 months causing a decline in my health status.

———————————Letter——————————-

Good morning,

I will not be signing the document and requesting an appeal due to some changes that have happened regarding the denial reason on the Reasonable Accommodation Request Form. 

The first reason for denial I would like to address is my covering the receptionist's lunch on Fridays from 12:45 pm to 1:15 pm as well as providing emergency coverage if the receptionist is not able to cover the front desk from 12:45 pm to 5:00 pm on Thursdays and Fridays. Due to my workload, I expressed concern to (Supervisor) and he reassured me that he would cover my reception emergency coverage since I would become very busy beginning Monday, August 5th running to Friday, June 6th. I would also like to note that the reception schedule has not changed from the time it was developed in August of 2023 to the day I write this email meaning that reception was not an actual issue when it came to my medical accommodation denial.

The second reason for denial is to prep the clinical staff welcome boxes. It took me a full week to order the materials and put the boxes together and as I am writing this email the boxes have been finished for some time and have put these boxes in a vehicle for transport to the school sites so they are officially out of my hands till next year late July.

Something that was not mentioned in the denial letter that was brought up in the accommodation meeting was the breakdown of my program charts. I have completed both the breaking down and the archiving of my program's charts at the time of this email. I have learned recently that this project was a group effort to put couches in the office sometime in September of this year so I have informed the facilitator of this project that I will help other Program Specialists break down and archive their charts till my program becomes active next week.

Another reason brought up in the meeting was my ability to complete projects outside of my program and unfortunately from the week of August 5th to June 5th, I will not have time to spare to work on anything that does not directly impact my program since I have the largest volume of work of my fellow NorCal Program Specialists which could be confirmed by my managers as well as anyone who has access to the organization's data. If there is a need for me to complete a project outside of my program then that would need to be facilitated with the Program Director to ensure that I will not be holding up the clinician's work with the participants.

With this being said it seems that there is no actual reason to deny my medical accommodations since I and (Employer) are in the same position as when my accommodations were first approved. I will not engage in any additional conversations discussing the validity or severity of my disability, I have provided all of the information required as I did when my accommodations request was first approved without question. I have included the reception coverage schedule from the time my accommodations request was approved as well as one from this week proving that the reception schedule has not changed preventing me from approval again.

I would like to have another conversation about being told multiple times how other employees impacted the decision to deny my disability accommodation. When I brought it up in the accommodations meeting this topic was dismissed being told that (Supervisor) misspoke, but I would like to understand how he misspoke about the same thing on multiple occasions when he is my direct supervisor and is informed of the lengths of my accommodations decision. 

I would like to keep this correspondence through email.

Thank you,

I need help figuring out the important things independent adults need to or can do,"I spent the last 8 years on government assistance, most of those years housebound, and now I'm being supported by less oppressive means. I know this is a privileged position to be in and I am beyond grateful I have this new support. My mobility has also improved with the support I've recieved and I am now able to get out of the house some of the time and consider a wider range of activities.

I gave up a lot during those 8 years. Some of it directly due to my limitations, and other things I gave up because of the conditions of government assistance and the paranoia of being accused of faking. I don't even remember all of it at this point.

I am now in my 30s and I don't really remember the variety of things independent adults might need or want to do. It feels a bit like turning 18 again. The only things I can think of are making a savings account and travelling beyond my province.

Section 8 housing question.,Im bipolar 1 and have not worked for 3 years. I applied for disability two years ago and was denied.

Director makes Rude Comments about my use of ADA to others - Is it worth reporting to HR?,"Hi,

Short and sweet. Employees have shared nasty comments my director made about me. If it helps at all, she's upset about accommodations that I was APPROVED for via ADA! Is it worth reporting if the coworkers are uncomfortable with corroborating the story to HR or the union? AKA acting as a witness &/or giving a statement etc.? I've been trying to brush them off but the comments do bother me a great deal and make me uncomfortable to say the least.

Comments include:

* insinuating that I have a romantic relationship with my supervisor to receive accommodations
* Verbally discussing her disdain for the fact that I have been approved to work (1) telework day

  
Additional Context:

This director was once my supervisor and declined my ADA request in the past! (aka about a year ago)",15,1eo3x8v,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eo3x8v/director_makes_rude_comments_about_my_use_of_ada/,8,1723220260.0

I'm so so embarrassed ,"So today I was at a private hospital because my boyfriend had recently gotten top surgery (yipee!!) and was getting his surgical drains removed. 

I started to feel a little woozy, and since I have a seizure/fainting mystery disorder, I turned to my bf to tell him that I felt bad and I was going to go sit down.

The next thing I woke up and was so disoriented that I thought I was watching a hospital drama on tv as like five nurses rushed to my side. Apparently the nurse tending to my bf had called a code...

I was awake after 10 seconds of convulsing and had a bunch of tests done. I was encouraged to go to the ER as I had smacked my head pretty loudly on the concrete floor. I had to wait around for twenty minutes as the many many doctors questioned me about my unknown disorder. 

I'm still so embarrassed about what happened. I wasn't even a patient in the hospital and I got a code called. I literally feel mortified.",77,1enrdrl,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1enrdrl/im_so_so_embarrassed/,12,1723179917.0

The Medical System is the US is just broken and sucks,"Sorry, but I just need to rant.  
  
I had a text conversation in MyChart last night with my pulmonologist, and now I am deflated. I am halfway tempted to take the money out of my 401k, go to Vegas for a hell of a weekend, sign my DNR, and refuse all further treatment.

I have a rare presentation of a rare degenerative neurological condition - Multifocal Motor Neuropathy with Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy. But with that, I also have autoimmune hemolytic anemia, fibromyalgia, COPD, asthma, migraines, intracranial hypertension, Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, and GERD. The irony is that if I only had any one of them, I'd be OK, but altogether, I am screwed. I'm losing strength in my diagram from the neuropathy, which is making the COPD worse, which means I don't get enough oxygen for my anemic blood. I get winded speaking for more than a few seconds or such strenuous activity as walking across the room to the bathroom. My quality of life is so bad that I cannot even concentrate enough to play video games, read, or follow the plot of a TV show on bad days. I watch TV, and I lose the plot and sleep. Luckily, that's only about 20% of the time, and the other 80% I can at least watch shows or play a game for a couple hours. The nerves to most of my sweat glands are gone so I can't sweat except on my head, armpits, and neck. I have gotten heat stroke twice now from being in the sun only a few minutes on days it was only in the 80s. My cold intolerance is almost as bad. No outdoor time for me anymore.

I'm continuing to get worse, and there is nothing more the doctors can do. This led me back to my conversation with my pulmonologist last night. She said she wished there was an internist or primary care doctor who led a team of specialists in a single office that could test and treat me holistically in a single inpatient setting until they found the best treatment plan for me, but that's not how it works. Instead, the hospital stabilizes my symptoms, writes me referrals to all my specialists, and sends me home. This is what happened last November when I passed out from hypoxia during my last COPD flare-up.

I feel I could get a better treatment plan with better medications and a higher quality of life if I could just be tested and treated for ALL my conditions at once. I have an awesome primary care doctor, and he tries to provide this type of care, but he still has to send me to specialists. There are weeks or months of delay getting appointments. The specialists have different levels of engagement and commitment to my overall health. 

The neurologist is overwhelmed, and while she tries, she's clearly burned out and ends up giving the bare minimum care. She repeats my nerve conduction tests annually, tracks the progress, and renews the prescription for my IVIG infusions for another six months. Two appointments a year—wash, rinse, repeat.

The cardiologist says I have the heart of a 25-year-old in my mid-50s body. All those decades of long-distance running, and I have a resting heart rate in the upper 40s, even with my high blood pressure. I'm 90 pounds overweight, and yet I have zero blockage of any blood vessels. So, while the cardiologist is great, there is nothing to do. It's not my heart causing my blood to pool in my feet, having edema down there, or giving me my orthostatic hypertension.

My pulmonologist is amazing. She is the most caring doctor with the best bedside manner. She checks up on me monthly online between our four-month appointments. She tweaks my CPAP as needed and is heavily engaged. She is as frustrated as I am that we can't get me a higher QoL. 

My rheumatologist is a DO instead of a MD. He is certainly willing to think outside the box. He supports my daily meditation, my yoga when I'm capable, and my CBT approach to pain management. He is frustrated he can't do more. Again, great doctor who is heavily engaged and just as frustrated as me.

Pain management is a nightmare. I see my third pain management doctor since moving to Georgia two years ago. Finding a good pain management doctor around Atlanta that isn't running a scam shop is difficult. The previous two were more concerned with having me try other services they offered rather than just write my monthly narcotics prescriptions. I've tried the chiropractic adjustments, massage, and acupuncture with some success, but they insist I continue to my annual maximum of insurance-allowed times whether it helps or not. And now after the opioid crisis, the first doctor was under investigation and the second doctor refused to write the prescriptions needed and proven to treat my pain for the last seven years. Hopefully the third one will be the charm. 

My therapist is a godsend. I seriously don't think I would still be here without her. She has helped coach me in CBT, sent me to classes, convinced me to try meditation all those years ago, and opened my mind to alternative pain management treatments and yoga. 

Both my GI doctor and urologist are good, kind, and have good bedside manners. There are no complaints, but they are both secondary and just dealing with the secondary effects of my primary issues. There is only so much the Urologist can do for a neurogenic bladder and since my significant other decided my illness was all too much for her, there has been no need to treat my ED. The GI doctor just gave the omeprazole prescription to primary care and repeats the colonoscopy every three years.

The spasming muscles got so back we had to up the baclofen after I pulled two muscles in my back from spasming and the being out of breath and dizzy have gotten so bad that I can't do my yoga anymore. Primary care and pulmonology are considering sending me back to Cardiology to repeat everything (it's only been a year) just to be doing something. I know how this will go. With the delays between each appointment, it will be a few months to be seen in the office, have the imaging and tests again, have the follow-up appointment just to be told again that everything is fine.

If it wasn't for my kids and grandkids, I would just give up, sign the DNR, and refuse all further treatment to get things over with as quickly as possible. That's not what I want - but with such a low quality of life, it is difficult. 

Thanks for letting me rant. I know I'm not the only one having these kinds of experiences. I still believe that if I could get all my specialists into one room for a week, admit me to the hospital for that week, and run any test or do any procedure, they need all right there in that week, I would have a better outcome. Unfortunately, that's not how healthcare works in my country.

So time to just keep on keeping on. ",59,1enovij,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1enovij/the_medical_system_is_the_us_is_just_broken_and/,9,1723171809.0

blood work reading gone wrong [among other things],"it is currently 3am and I cannot sleep for the life of me, anyway
this post is a bit pointless. i just wasn't sure where to let out the steam to so I decided that this subreddit was the best place.


a few months ago, I think, back in March or April, I decided it was finally time to actually address my health issues. ya see, I was always the biggest kid of the class, the slowest, the least athletic and whatnot. it's not that I didn't do sports - I'd often run around the playground with the friend I had back then, I'd always participate in p.e class, and I even did ballet for 6 whole years, and contemporary dance for 3 years. 

and yet, I never lost weight. I never got better stamina, never improved my strength, nothing. as a kid I didn't think much of it (frankly, I barely thought at all). 

but now, the more I look at it from an outside perspective, the more I realise how abnormal that was. and this issue worsened as years passed to the point where in high-school, I ended up being terrified of p.e class. I went, but I didn't do anything, because I knew I wouldn't even be able to do half the warm-up without coughing up my lungs.

and nobody ever took me seriously. 

they (the teachers, my parents, fuck even the doctors) just took one look at my overweight ass and declared that all I needed was more physical activity. like, no shit sherlock, but that's kinda quite literally the problem. no one ever listened when I voiced my concerns about my health and struggles and instead they superglued a tag that reads ""lazy"" to my forehead and I can't take it off.

so, in March, after an unrelated incident, I thought that now that I'm in college, it was finally fucking time to just look for the answers on my own. and boy did I look. POTS, ehlers danlos syndrome, hypermobility, you name it, I searched everything I could find. 

then I found a new primary care doctor, and they're an angel without wings. they're the only one who actually listens to me. but as a generalist, there isn't much they can actually do, so they bad to send me to specialists.

i got a whole bunch of tests in May. a couple weeks before, I had gotten a blood work, so I also brought those results to the specialist in charge of me at the hospital. 

turns out, all my tests came back 'normal'. even the blood work. I guess a lot of you can understand how frustrating that is. 

but, like half an hour ago, as I was tossing and turning, I thought back to a funny reel about iron deficit that I had sent to a friend. I was like ""damn, I relate way too much to that, tf is up with that?""

so with no grand hope I open up Google. and boy.

turns out iron deficit can very easily be missed or dismissed by doctors. and that 'normal' blood work results are actually not so normal.

it's frustrating. just the fact that the answer might’ve  been that simple all along and people just... laughed at my face and for what? just for a misreading of a goddamn number?

it's really fucking frustrating. I've been fighting with so-called specialists for months just for them to tell me that it was a waste of time. just for them to outright ignore the whole damn thing because they can't be bothered or some shit like that.

why don't doctors just fucking listen honestly? I kinda wanna cry now from how frustrating that whole ordeal is.",1,1eoe6vj,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eoe6vj/blood_work_reading_gone_wrong_among_other_things/,4,1723245510.0
Wanting some dating advice :),"So a few weeks back at university I had a bit of a meet cute with this girl, as we got to know eachother I am completely head over heels for her in a way I haven't quite been before.

It's not that I'm blindly in love, but more so the way she talked aligned with so much of who I am, and left me feeling so inspired and in awe. Long story short she's very cool and I'm forming a bit of a crush.

She is very open about her chronic illnesses, which seem to be quite severe and impactful to her daily life, and I wanted to ask how navigating a relationship like this could work?

As much as I'd like to be ignorant and say love will prevail and solve all problems, I don't think it would be that simple. Ontop of the chronic illnesses she has also opened up about her complex PTSD.

Historically I've noticed I tend to be very much a ""caretaker"" or ""saviour"" to the people close to me and it's something I've been told by in everyone in my life I should dial down. However I don't feel my attraction towards this beautiful person is that I would be a ""saviour"" it's moreso that I've fallen for someone who also has chronic conditions and want to know if that's something I can navigate.

Disability disclosure form while applying to jobs - CA ,"I have PTSD from a trauma that happened while I was at my current job (unrelated to work), and I’m now looking for new opportunities so I can make some more money because therapy is getting really expensive, and also I just need to move on in my career. 

My PTSD can be triggered by driving, so I feel I need to disclose my disability to places I’m applying that are fully on-site or hybrid or a considerable distance from where I live, in case I need to work from home. I know this can be potentially harmful to my chances of getting hired in the first place, and also many people run into issues with their employer when it comes to accommodation/discrimination once hired. But also…I’m coming across this form on applications that says federal contractors are required by law to measure their progress toward having 7% of their workers be qualified ppl with disabilities, which leads me to believe it would actually be an advantage for me to disclose? But I’m confused because it says no one who makes hiring decisions will see my answer…so then…how does that work???

How to Help My Disabled Brother in a Toxic Household,"Hey Reddit,

I'm looking for some advice on how to help my younger brother, Daniel, who is 22. For context, I’m 29, and due to some family issues, I'm staying anonymous and using fake names.

Daniel has always shown and still shows signs of autism, such as extreme social anxiety, repetitive movements, difficulty making eye contact, trouble with school work, struggles with managing time, finding it difficult to understand and following spoken instructions, speaking very quietly all the time, and being sensitive to loud sounds.

During childhood, He was kept in the same grade for an extra year at school. When he was a child, he only had symptoms of facial twitches, doing the same movements over and over, and repeating words and actions a lot, like saying ""Hey it's Lesslie"" more than 50 times in a row in less than 10 minutes, many times every day for over 2 years. Currently, Daniel requires repeated instruction to perform tasks and reminders to attend to his basic needs like food, sleep, and hygiene. He experiences extreme social anxiety and struggles with communication and following directions independently, which impacts his ability to work or attend school.

Here’s the situation: Daniel is currently residing in our parents' exceedingly toxic household. Our stepfather, Kyle, exerts an overwhelming level of control over Daniel. Throughout his childhood, Kyle prevented Daniel from being evaluated for autism, despite recommendations from teachers and therapists. Even as an adult, Daniel has sought an autism evaluation, only to be denied by his father, despite recommendations from therapists and now even doctors. To our knowledge, he has not been officially diagnosed with autism. Tragically, our mother passed away in 2022, leaving Daniel without crucial support. Since then, his father has deprived him of access to his medical records, car, finances, and even his house keys.

I left home when I turned 18 because my stepfather treated everyone in the family unfairly, claiming he was ""the head of the household."" Now that I'm in college, I can barely support myself and can't afford to have Daniel live with me since he doesn't have any income. We both want to explore getting him on a disability program for benefits and finding supportive job placement.

I’m thinking of contacting my county’s regional center and reaching out to his doctors to try to retrieve his medical records. He is currently on Medi-Cal. 

Does anyone have any advice on what steps I should take next or resources in California that could help? Thanks in advance for any guidance.",8,1entu87,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1entu87/how_to_help_my_disabled_brother_in_a_toxic/,3,1723189379.0

I mean we might go to the store twice in a week occasionally if we forgot something like regular ppl do but who goes 2 times every week????

They apparently denied me because my doctors who oversee my medication treatment say my medication is working for the most part. Like yeah, it makes it so I'm not in psychosis or panicing and completely freaking put every second of every day. It doesn't make me actually functioning though. It makes me barely even past the level of what could be considered ""sane"". 

I still can't get behind the wheel of a car, or even really even be a passenger when anyone but my husband is driving. I still have to check like 30 different things before going to bed every night. I still can't be in the dark or go outside at night by myself out of fear. I still feel like I'm being watched all the time. These plus tons more are still real issues for me.

I have no hope,"I really need a reason to keep carrying on. Every time I am hopeful for a treatment, it fails. Every time I get my hopes up about a new doctor, a new medication, a new treatment, it’s only a matter of time before the shoe drops and I’m worse. 

I moved up getting my endoscopy by over a week. I got it moved up so my GI could have treatment answers, something to help, something to make me suffer even a little less.

I applied for disability and I feel extremely guilty,"I mostly just want to get this off my chest. I am 23. I have bipolar (diagnosed this year), DID (noted as soon as 13, but ""official"" last year), GAD (5 years old), PTSD (13, coked hand in hand with DID), PNES (16), BPD (not actuallysure when), and some kind of chronic pain/fatigue I highly suspect to be fibromyalgia (I am on a medication mainly aimed at people with it, which has helped a lot with my symptoms. not self diagnosing, I just feel like it's just a bit obvious at this point but am hoping to get tested soonish)

some background, feel free to skip.

I'm working with my dr to figure out physical issues, as i was neglected as a child and had a relapse of a birth defect that was never fixed (cubfoot). after taking a year off after high school I started working, and after that my physical and mental health has severely declined. I have been in an out of therapy for very nearly 10 years now.

after a recent trauma that left me hospitalized last year (I got verbally harassed and threatened by a family member i was living with and kicked out. long, long, long story) and extremely stressful workplaces, I honestly can't even think about filling out a job application too hard without blacking out and some pretty gruesome stuff happening.

everytime I tried in the past almost 2 years now, (s/h) >!I blacked out and ""came back to"" with my legs, arms, and torso covered in cuts.!< while I was working I developed an ED, s/h addiction (with no previous serious s/h attempts), and was on the verge of suicide every week or so. the only thing that kept me from actually attempting was my severe fear of failing and ending up hospitalized.

I've probably seen 15-20 different therapists. a lot were while in an intensive out patient program. a lot dropped me bc my case was too complex for them. some just stopped showing up one day and they'd take weeks to find me a new one. my last therapist, a DID specialist, ended out sessions because I was too complex for her.

my step grandmother was physically and mentally disabled, but died with disability still denying her. my step dad always held this over my head, and how I wasn't ""as bad as her"" so I didn't deserve ""hand outs"" but she did. he died a few years ago, but I can still hear his lectures in my head.

some therapists (including a DID """"specialist"""")told me they wouldn't help bc they didn't believe in disability for mental illnesses. other people could function fine with it, so why couldn't I?

end of background

I feel so guilty for not working because i'm *technically* able to. I know I'm going to get denied and I don't know what to do. it really, to me, is less of a question if I can and more of if I should for my own safety and sanity. I kept avoiding sending in the paperwork bc I felt so guilty and thought if I just gave myself time and the right medications I'd be able to work. or the right therapist, but it's looking like that won't be happening any time soon.

I feel horrifically guilty for thinking I'm disabled. I've finally gotten past it a bit, but filling out the paperwork caused a lot of distress. I probably s/h'd while doing it honestly. after months of it sitting on my desk complete I had to ask a family member to send it for me because I just couldn't without spiraling.

I've very, very worried about this process and how it will affect me. by all means therapy would help, but realistically it could take me 10 more years just to find one willing to work with me long term. medication has helped with my bipolar and pain, but not the black outs and other stuff. it's extremely stressful.

My mum got mad at me asking for a wheelchair ,"Okay, so this happened today and it made me feels like shit.

I've recently been using my desk chair (it's one of the ones on wheels) to get around, and it's helping a lot, but I realised it would be a lot easier to use a wheelchair.

So I told my mum, ""hey, I think we should look into getting me a wheelchair""

And she got super weird about it. She asked me if I was serious in a super condescending tone (it sounded like she was gonna laugh) and when I said I was, she told me we needed to ""look into what's wrong with me"" and got super mad!

We've already been going to doctors and that, including a physician for physical therapy, but even if I get a diagnosis it wouldn't be an instant cure! I told her this, and said we should look into stuff that would help me NOW too.

She just brushed me off!

I'm 15, so there's no way for me to get one on my own, and most days I can barely make my muscles get out of bed! They're just too weak and  it's too much effort, and it's not made any easier by the fact that my antidepressants have stopped working.

Should I try for disability or no?,"So I have multiple health problems. My main one being my spine. I don’t know how to pronounce or spell it lol. When I was 15/16 I was in so much pain I could barely move and it hurt to breathe because of it. My family kept telling me “walk it off you’ll be fine” “you have to move around or it will just get worse” finally a week into being in excruciating pain I told my mom in tears that I needed to go to the hospital. They did X-rays and gave me a muscle relaxer. The muscle relaxer helped almost immediately and I felt like I could run a marathon. They came in, sat down and told me that basically my spine wasn’t attached and my tailbone was being pushed out of my back. They said they usually only see this in cheerleaders, and I was not a cheerleader. They originally said it was caused from cracking my back so much because that’s the only thing they could think of. They sent me to a spine specialist and I got an mri and more X-rays. They really didn’t do anything for me they just told me to call back in and make an appointment if my symptoms got worse. So about two years later after nothing getting better with pt and feeling like I was going nowhere, I called and made an appointment. They gave me a new specialist and he did X-rays and an mri. He pulled up my imaging and was comparing it to the last ones I had done and saw that I’m missing a bone between my tailbone and spine. So it was not caused by cracking my back I was born without a bone. 

Being told that I was born without this bone really made me start thinking back. My whole life I couldn’t stand in one spot for long periods of time and I couldn’t lay on my stomach for very long. My pediatrician always said “your back muscles must not be strong enough” but now we know it was this causing it. 

With all that being said I was told I am not disabled because surgery could fix the problem. Personally I don’t want spine surgery at 19 years old. The surgeon I saw also said he wants to push off surgery for as long as possible. So I have no choice but to work. I finally decided to try it out this year. I got a job at Walmart and I started on June 5th. With every day standing on the concrete floor I can feel my spine getting worse. I’m 3 months in and considering quitting. I’ve looked and looked for a desk job or a remote job and I cannot find anything I can do. I don’t think I can hold on much longer with Walmart. 

Now my problem is I don’t like the idea of going back to not having my own money. It scares me so bad. I can chance it and try to fight for disability but I was told I’m not disabled. I’ve been stressing over what to do for almost a month now. 

I also have severe ibs, uncontrollable migraines, (undiagnosed) social anxiety, I have a problem with my liver and spleen, inappropriate heart rhythm, and I’m on about 12-14 medications. 

I’m lucky to go one day without being in some kind of pain. I’m lucky to go one week without getting a pinched nerve and being stuck in bed all day. My spine problem has limited what I can do my whole life, but it has gotten so much worse since I was diagnosed. I have told my specialist this and he still says I’m not disabled. I sometimes have to wait days to take a shower. I can’t cook for myself most of the time because I can’t stand long enough to do it. Working has made all of this 10x worse.

Any advice on what I should do?",2,1enrrf1,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1enrrf1/should_i_try_for_disability_or_no/,12,1723181268.0
"For the visibly disabled, how do you deal with the constant staring?","I got a mobility scooter 2 years ago and it has CHANGED MY LIFE. It has given me my life back and I was able to go back to work.

But perhaps because I look quite young on a mobility scooter, I get stared at every time I leave my house, by every person I come across. 

I'm sure my experience isn't unique. Staring is a result of living in an inaccessible world where visibly disabled people are not common in everyday life. I know I can't control their actions, but I can control how I deal with it. So, how do you all deal with it? 

I honestly don't have the energy to even engage anymore with actions like staring back or waving or smiling since it's literally every single person I pass. I fear going past a line of people because I know I'll be treated like a parade float and all those eyes will turn to stare at me.

BC Disability help/suggestions,"So, I moved from Ontario to BC about a year ago. I had diagnosis (ADHD (was taking adderall, the only thing keeping me afloat), anxiety, depression, suspected autism, PSTD- I know for sure I have chronic fatigue though that isn’t currently diagnosed) and had been on ODSP for 4 years already. I did not realize that none of this information or my ODSP, would come with me. 
If you’re wondering why I moved, it’s because I have always wanted to live in BC and I noticed that Ontario had very quick and suddenly caught up in price. I wanted so badly to be somewhere I thought would help me feel better and heal my mind, even if just a little!! Why suffer somewhere I don’t want to be and pay the same price? After my dad took his own life a few years ago and left me a small inheritance, I thought; I can’t go out like him, I know he’d want me to be happy…so I moved.

The past year has been hell. No Dr, no disability, no ADHD medication, and worlds of struggling + debt.
I am on assistance, but it is not NEARLY enough. $1000 a month doesn’t even pay rent. I can’t work, but I am FORCED to (I can only manage 2 days a week), and I can’t make more than $500 or they will start taking from the assistance funds. I have to call and beg and explain I cannot for the life of me, find a Dr to sign PWD papers cos they ask constantly and say they will take me off assistance if I don’t have medical proof of being unable to work. 
Every day I feel like I am drowning. 

Every night I get the bad thoughts, because I am SO lost on what to do. I can barely do phone calls, and yet I am forced to do them constantly! The amount of circles I have been directed in…I am genuinely terrified of every day and any $ spent on anything for survival. If I didn’t have that money from my dad, I would 100% be homeless and probably be dead by now, if I am being entirely honest. The amount I spent to pay off credit card debt makes me ill, and those funds are Dwindling Fast, my friends. I can’t even go back to Ontario now (not that I’d want to), because all my supports from there are gone now too after I moved.

After exhausting my resources and, well, myself, going in so many circles just to be met with hysterical disappointment again and again, I am at the point where— I am just desperate for an answer, or some kind of hope. I currently live on Vancouver Island, near Nanaimo. 
Does anyone have any help or suggestions?? (Hopefully no more circles though, I am exhausted) I am all ears. Even if I have to pay just to get someone to sign some papers…I’ll do it. I just don’t understand any of this, and navigating it alone has ruined me. 

I’m so tired guys. Please help me 😭 I really hope there is something out there that I just don’t know about or haven’t tried yet, gah. Idk how anyone is supposed to navigate, let alone live in this system and why nothing is being done, this is so messed up. I am overwhelmed and my brain doesn’t work in these ways it is forced to be working.
Anyway thanks for reading, I’m sorry to anyone else that feels similar to myself…we’ll get through this. I hope so badly there’s answers for us, anything 🤞 ",0,1env2c4,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1env2c4/bc_disability_helpsuggestions/,7,1723194483.0

For the story behind it, I always knew there Was something off with me. Thing is, SPD wasn't known very well at this time so I wondered if I could have autism or ADHD. At this time, my sister said I was hypochondriac making the whole family laugh. I later told my mother many time how much it hurt me to which she responded with ""but that was just a joke"".

Then I was diagnosed with SPD and because I know SPD is often a comorbidity, I wanted to know if I had autism and ADHD. Turns out I don't have autism but it's impossible to say for ADHD because the symptoms are similar to those of my SPD right now.

I told that to my sister because she was talking about it when we were in the restaurant. Then she respond with the same ""joke"". I tried to respond but famously failed and just shut myself. My mother noticed and told me again that it was ""just a joke""...

It could have stopped right there but then a woman sitting behind us came to ask if my sister could move her dog because her husband was allergic. The second they were gone, my mother said straight out that she couldn't understand why she stayed with her husband because of how annoying it must be to care for him...

Can I buy a house and run a small business (bookshop) if my child is on Disability? (NY),"My 15 year old child is likely to be approved for Disability benefits within the next 3 months. As a single Mama running a small business in an undesirable location, my hope is to use part of his lump sum back-payment to purchase a home that will also contain our business. 

My son approves of this use of his money, is excited about the idea, and hopes to work with me to expand the business. Having him under my wing while he learns business skills is also another huge plus for his development and eventual independence. 

But I know that if an elderly person is on Medicaid and goes into nursing care, their home is often seized as a means of recovering the cost of those benefits. 

I’m worried I’ll pour a lifetime of work into our family home and business, only to have it seized if anything ever happens to me, and my children wouldn’t even have the right to sell it. 

I’m not sure my child could ever live independently in the home without me if something did happen to me, even when he’s an adult. 

Am I right to be concerned that if he’s approved for Disability, our property could eventually be seized? Or does this not apply to me because he’s his own person receiving benefits in his own name? He is currently a minor though, and I’m the custodial parent. 

Pictured: Vintage children’s books available through our bookshop. The current location is little more than a storage unit - with eight leaks in the roof, causing significant loss of inventory. I’m desperate to expand into a real bookshop to support us.

ICE prep,"I feel like it’s extremely important to have an end of life/emergency directory and a list of all your important documents and info in an accessible place. I keep everything locked up and in specific places so if something ever happens to me certain people can find it quickly.  Only them and me know where my keys and codes are too. I also keep records of everything just to be safe. 

I put a list of important phone numbers and item locations on my fridge and my personal ICE info on the back of that. But some info is only in my locked locations for safety reasons. You’ll only get my emergency contacts and a few other important details without my keys and codes. 

Due to being constantly on the move for so many years I have a rule of thumb now: if it can’t fit in the trunk of a regular car it’s not convenient enough. That rule only applies to my important stuff (like if there’s a fire I’m running in for it level of importance). I rather have a few heavy containers than a bunch of lighter ones that won’t fit in a car trunk.

What are my chances of getting accepted for disability benefits?,"I’ll try to keep this short. I’m 23 y/o born female. From the age of 14, I have been sent inpatient AT LEAST once every year for my mental health up to now. But I have had multiple hospitalizations during several years, and some residential care for an eating disorder several times. I have tried many medications, therapists, and have been cooperating with my care.

I also have a chronic pain/illness, but we are struggling to find a diagnosis. I have been working since I was 18, and have always had to quit due to my mental health getting so severe, or my pain making me physically unable to work. I have tried all kinds of jobs- retail, fast food, with accommodations, instacart, sitting factory job (that was highly accommodating but my pain was still too severe to continue), a physical hotel cleaner job, and a few others. I have tried many OTC pain meds, and even perscribed meds from my rheumatologist, with no luck. Physical therapy helped, but didn’t so enough. I stopped going because all the exercises I did there, I could do at home, and since I don’t have an income, I am tight on money (I have none actually).

This past October, I got to my breaking point. I quit my last job, and haven’t worked since. The pain got so bad, I was fantasizing about su*cide (which is usually what happens, then I get hospitalized). I applied for disability benefits this past march.

Now I know it is very likely I get denied given this is my first application, and I am young. I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anorexia, OCD/anxiety, C-PTSD. And for physical health, I am diagnosed with PCOS, Scoliosis, peroneal neuropathy in my right leg, and mild chronic gastritis. I have had physical pain issues since I was 16, and didn’t get diagnosed with anything until I was maybe 19.

My therapist said the SSI people contacted him, which is a good sign. I gave them every single inpatient, outpatient, and residential program I have been to, so they could get the records, as well as every ER, and specialist I have seen (gastro, neuro, psych, rheumo, etc.).

I know a lot of cases get denied. But I don’t know if most cases of people my age have the mental health history I have. If I don’t get accepted for my physical, I feel there is at least a better chance of getting accepted for my mental health issues.

But I need to know. How much should I get my hopes up? i try to keep them as low as I can. But I am desperate to know what my chances are. I cannot live like the rest of my peers- I cannot work or function like them.

Valid use of mobility aids?," So I'm autistic, but also have been dealing with chronic pains for almost 2 years now (I am going to be 18 in September.)

 Specically pains in my left shoulder and the back of my thighs, which often make it more difficult for me to stand in place for too long and long walks, as well as going up hill, I'm often leaning agaisnt walls or using a railing to walk up steps. 

Ontop of this I have been traveling more on trains specically, because I'm autistic I tend to move around a lot due to stimming,, but i felt like it was not a valid reason to sit in the disability section. Even though I'm sure I'd feel better physically and mentally having the extra space around me.

Now back to the chronic pain I have been looking at walking cane's recently hopefully to relive the physical pain in my legs and arm, but I'm physically able to walk, just not without pain. 

I'm also sort of wondering if it's not disrespectful to use a mobility aid to be more visually disabled so I'm not bombarded with the ""you look fine"" when I'm actually in tons of pain--? Idk If any of this is repetitive or has been asked before but I've been overthrow it along with other things and just want to hear others opinions.

Can anyone please help me with some advise?,"Let me start by saying that I am not trying to sell anything here. I am not advertising. I am honestly asking for an idea to solve a terrible situation I am stuck in.

Last year, my power wheelchair almost got on fire. It couldn’t be fixed, so I decided that next time, I would get a new one that could go up and down (meaning lift me in a higher position, I’m sure that many of you understand how important that is). 

And so, I created a gofundme, and with the help of many loving people, I got the wheelchair that I needed. I had to go pick it up in the States because they didn’t sell it here, in Colombia. I was so very exited. But then it all became a nightmare.

I understood (through the hard way), why this chair is not sold in Colombia: because here everything has stairs and obstacles. Truly, the USA seems like a paradise to me in that regard. 

And the thing is… I never before in my life cared about stairs or obstacles, because when I happened to find them, I would just ask for help! I never minded asking others for help, so, with my old chair (the one from the fire story), I would just get some guys to carry me up or down, and there I was! Inside of every place that I wanted to be without even thinking about it!

Now that has become like a distant dream… because this wheelchair is so, so, so heavy that carrying it up and down stairs becomes dangerous and it’s incredibly difficult.

On top of everything my car that had a ramp got damaged permanently, so getting that chair into other people’s cars is impossible. 
Literally, I have become Rapunzel. I am stuck at home and I’m desperate 😭. I can’t do it anymore. 

I have tried to sell this heavy chair here, but for obvious reasons, no one in this country will buy it.

I got and invitation and I’m traveling to USA very soon. So, I want to take it with me to sell it there, as of course, for a country with such accessibility, it’s a fantastic bought. 

I am obviously trying to sell this chair through the normal sites but I wonder if any of you guys know about a place to sell things specifically related to wheelchairs and health aids.

Truly I need to sell it so that I can pay some debts and buy a new chair that will fit Colombian needs.

Thank you so much for reading me and I would be always grateful for any selling tips! 🙏🏻💖",4,1emvouz,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1emvouz/can_anyone_please_help_me_with_some_advise/,0,1723087352.0
Feeling guilty about missing work ,"I work a very labor intensive job outdoors which is probably not a good decision with my disabilities but I took the job because it's something I'm so passionate about. I adore my job and the people I work with but I always feel so guilty when I miss work.

i think i’m disabled,"super long rant. i just got insurance this week so i’ve been trying to figure out where to start with all of this. but most of all, just trying to accept how things are right now.
most days, i can barely walk. i can’t leave the house without a cane if i’m going to be walking more than 15 minutes at a time. otherwise the pain is horrible and i lose balance. i have shocking pains that feel like my veins hurt in my legs coming from my joints.
same thing throughout my arms, shoulders, and neck. every day my left arm never stops hurting no matter what i do. my muscles swell up and hurt to the touch. i have permanent numbness in my right hip. i can’t feel the left side of my body as much as my right, but it hurts more(??) and numbness comes and goes in my legs if i’m standing too long in one place and in my arms if i have a flair up of pain or if there’s any pressure (like laying on my arm or sitting crossed for longer than a minute)
i just moved to a new state with my partner and our cat, and i had a job for 4 days before i almost threw up and my boss sent me home and i had to quit. i’ve tried applying to jobs in person and trying to figure out a way to make an income with no luck. i only have experience working in retail the last couple years but i know i can’t do that anymore and i’m not qualified for anything else. my physical health keeps declining where i can barely go out anywhere and my partner keeps telling me that i don’t have to get a job and to just focus on my health.
but the guilt of that is unbearable. i have never just focused on my health but maybe that’s what’s gotten me here. last year i was in rehab for mental health and i was working 45 hours a week on top of that! i was working 3 jobs just earlier this year. i don’t know how to just rest and take care of myself without feeling a horrible amount of guilt. every time i have a better day i gaslight myself and feel like my days spent not being able to walk or move at all weren’t real until i’m hit with a brick of pain again.
my partner was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 6 years ago and since then has made huge improvements and has learned to understand and accept the things he can and can’t do.
i have a lot to learn from him honestly. and we talk about these things almost every day. because a lot of my symptoms are just like how his were. and knowing that gives me hope, but i don’t want this.
i know no one does, but i can’t accept this. i don’t know how.
he wants to take me to a hospital soon, and i’m terrified.
i’ve spent a lot of my life in hospitals for mental health. over a year total from all my psych ward stays, and a year in rehab. and now here’s another thing.

Am I worth being in my marriage?,"I (27 f) have been with my husband we’ll call J (28 m) for about 12 years now. We were high school sweethearts and got married about 6 years ago. In the past 4 years, my health has severely declined and I am now well past the point of being disabled (I am still in the process of accepting this fully). I have been diagnosed with POTS, MS, CFS, MDD, OCD, PTSD, PNES, chronic pain, and several other things I am probably forgetting, my cognitive function is not up to par at this time. 

My main struggle is, I feel like I bring absolutely nothing to the table when it comes to our marriage. I’m unable to work, I’ve been bed bound about 70-80% of the time past year. I’m unable to do virtually anything around the house cleaning wise without risking a flare up or syncope (I have syncope episodes nearly every day and have found nothing to make them better). I can’t cook for him like I used to, I can’t drive anywhere, I can’t even shower without his help. I feel so incredibly awful with him working full time, taking care of the household as well as tending to me and virtually all of my needs. I do have a decent amount of family support, but they do not live with us and can’t lift all the burden off him. 

I’ve had multiple conversations with J about how I feel and he has expressed over and over again that he doesn’t feel overwhelmed and loves me no matter what. He has always been the most caring, kind, and understanding person I’ve known. Never once has he gotten irritated with anything or complained. All he says he wants is for me to feel better, let him know how he can help, and make me feel safe, but I just can’t help the feeling that he is keeping it all bottled up inside. 

I’m curious if anyone else has had any similar struggles and how you cope/if anyone has any advice for me or J. Anything is appreciated 🩶

I don’t think I can handle being a disabled adult - I don’t feel like a woman.,"I (F21) have been in a wheelchair for like 90% of my life, but now I’m in my 20s I can’t accept it. 

I know it’s lame. But I feel so out of control of my life yet completely in control and it’s really hard to explain.

As a kid and teen, you kind of expect to be looked after but at adulthood you’re not supposed to have someone wipe your ass for you. Especially your own mother.

It’s killing me inside. It’s killing me that my own personal care feels so unpersonal. For example - and not to be too weird and over share - but I dread my period every month but not just because it hurts and I’m literally bleeding. But because I can’t just feel gross alone and have privacy. 

I can’t physically deal with it myself like most physical personal things. But I can’t mentally deal with it either. I can’t do it. 

Every gross personal thing that people deal with, I have to have someone else do it. 

And it would only be marginally better if it was not my own mother. If I had my own life and my own personal assistant where I was in full control.

But I don’t have that and getting that isn’t that simple.

I don’t feel like a woman, and I really want to. 

I feel like a baby who is so far beneath everyone else my age. 

Edit: The issue isn't the period itself, that’s just one part of the story. It was 5am and most of the time my thoughts don't translate into words the best so I used the best example I could think of. Plus I didn't want to get too personal on here.

Short term disability questions,"**Brief history** – I am facing personal issues with my ex due to which I am having a lot of anxiety. And with my boss being tough on me, the anxiety is going through the roof. I am always under the threat that I will be fired soon. This has taken a toll on my health, sleep and thought process. I am always thinking very negative, ruminating about things almost all the time. I don’t feel like getting up for work or taking up any new work. I always like to delay deliverables and cancel meetings. My aim here is to take a few months off and focus on my health as work pressure is further deteriorating my health and outlook in general.

I am having sessions with a licensed psychology professional counselor who has told me that she has filled out multiple FEMA forms for different companies. I chose her as she is part of the ComPsych network which my company provides sessions with.

**Questions –**

1.      My company has 20 weeks (6.5 months) of time off for short term disability in which they pay 70% of salary. Can I ask for full 6.5 months for anxiety? The counselor says she is willing to fill up the form for full 6.5 months if that’s what I feel. The counselor has mentioned that she has filled up the FEMA forms for multiple people in different big organizations. Not sure if things get approved easy?

2.      Please note, the short-term disability is being handled by a third party and not directly by my organization. I have spoken to the third party, and they told me that I must apply for the leave on an online portal with start and end dates. The mail will go to my manager and the HR as soon as I submit. Once I submit the application, they will send me the forms to fill out which I will provide to the counselor to fill out. And from there, they will take 24-48 hours to take a decision on approval or rejection.

3.      I would personally like to avail the entire 6.5 months, but wanted to know your opinion if that is a good route to take **purely** from approval/rejection standpoint. Or shall I apply for 3 months initially and then keep extending it by a month every time till I reach the limit of 6 to 6.5 months.

4.      How easy or difficult is it to get the short-term disability leaves to get approved? The counselor said she hasn’t seen any rejection but also hasn’t said if someone took 6 months. I wanted to take opinion of people who have gone through this process.

5.      In short term disability, how is the leave paid? Is it paid by insurance or my organization? Does it come exactly how it comes in our bi-weekly paychecks, or would it be different?

6.      I also see a 12-month medical leave option which is for our company. All the company related leaves are paid at 100% but I am not sure about the procedure. I am hesitant to talk to HR directly about it. What if just before I am planning to apply for the leave (once I am decided about the dates), will it be a good idea to talk to the HR to inform her about my current emotional and mental state and in that meeting while discussing options can ask her what is the 12 months sick leave policy?

7.      What happens if I get an approval and on my return my organization fires me? Does the new company (if I get another job) get to know that I took short term disability benefits in any of the previous organizations?

8.      Any other things that I should be considering that I am not thinking about or should be worried about?

Renting while on LTD,"Hey everyone. As of the beginning of this year, I am on LTD (long term disability). I receive 60% of my previous income via private disability insurance that I paid into for several years. I am not on SSI or SSDI (I did submit an application for SSDI, which is still being processed). When I transitioned from STD (short term disability) to LTD, I was terminated from my employer (termination type was due to medical inability to return to work/eligible for rehire). My LTD was approved for 2 years, meaning I will continue receiving 60% of my previous income through the end of that time period. I pay for health insurance out of pocket. I am now 7 months into said disability. I was living in another state and knew I wanted and needed to move back to my previous city, so I quickly rented a flat virtually while still on payroll, knowing my employment might end. This was beneficial because it got me from point A to B without too much overthinking, however, there are issues with this place and I don't feel comfortable living here, plus I know I'm overpaying and with the issues experienced living here plus not working, I'm eager to move to a place that's less expensive and where I feel comfortable. I have never attempted to rent a place without a job. I do live in an area with a competitive rental market, though my disability salary is still OK. I have some savings which I've been using to supplement my income. I'm curious if anyone has been in the situation where they've had to apply for and rent an apartment while unemployed but receiving disability income. I'm not interested in low income housing, so I'd be applying alongside people who are employed. I feel a bit nervous mentioning that I'm not employed but have income guaranteed through disability, because what landlord wants to hear that especially if there are people who are employed willing to rent. Should I just stay where I'm at, despite the issues, and plan to move once I'm working again? I was trying to avoid this situation, but I don't have the emotional or physical energy to stay and be uncomfortable and feel it's in my best interest to move.",1,1emp0a2,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1emp0a2/renting_while_on_ltd/,6,1723068741.0
Olympics viewing- general discussion,"Hello all,

I’ve only come to think of myself as having a disability within the last two years. I first got CFS/ME 15 years ago as a senior in high school. I went from being a varsity rower, doing yoga five days a week, and weightlifting three times a week to sleeping 14 hours a day overnight. Since then (now 32 yo), I have worked full time on and off, and my health has declined significantly in the last couple of years to the point where I can’t hold a job or maintain my basic care for myself (eating, showering, all those things). I got my officially diagnosis of CFS/ME about six years ago. 

This is the first Olympics that I have watched while really struggling with day to day health and knowing that this is likely a forever condition. 

Does anyone else experience a myriad of emotions while watching them? 

On one hand, it really makes me feel grief and loss for what my body used to be able to do. I know I will never be able to excel at all of the physical activities I used to love. But, on the other hand, I am really so much more impressed with the peak athleticism that these games display. It’s been making it so much more enjoyable to see what peak human performance can look like. 

I’ve also watched some of the paralympics, which is also bringing up a lot of thoughts and emotions that I didn’t know that I had. When i see running events with people who are running with blades, all i can think is “oh they are just missing a limb, but the rest of their body is healthy, ugh im so jealous, i could run if only i was like them.” It’s really crappy having a condition that means exerting yourself is actively making your health worse and I haven’t really felt this level of jealousy or comparison to other people’s bodies in years and years. That said, there are also so many inspiring and wonderful stories about the wonderful athletes that I do find uplifting and heartwarming. 

Does anyone else have all of these mixed emotions around the Olympics? ",2,1emjc94,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1emjc94/olympics_viewing_general_discussion/,10,1723055117.0
How do you accept that your disability...disables you?,"I was diagnosed with Autism and other learning disabilities earlier this year and have another illness we're working out but I'm having to accept my limitations that I thought I could overcome are just part of me now. Longest job I've held was 4 months and every other job was 1-2 months since so I'm trying for disability for some stability. I've worked with vocational rehabilitation ect and it's just noy as possible as I'd originally hoped. I'm realizing a lot of things are purely too difficult for me and it sucks. 

Growing up thinking I could do/be anything to understanding I have very real limitations that will keep me from a lot of opertunites is honestly crushing. 


Edit; Thank you everyone, it seems it's a case by case thing of how you see it yourself and how you acknowledge it effects you and your life.

Anime convention tips,"Hey friends,   
This weekend I'm going to an anime convention and I was wondering if people have some tips?    
I tried googling for articles, but only found tips for the venues, not tips for the disabled people itself.        

I am going to use my convertible walker to wheelchair, probably mostly in wheelchair form. I have a fan, cooling towels, granola bars for snacks. Got a big water bottle too. Have marked he accessible toilets on the map. I'm going to pay the first aid room a visit asking if they know a place where I can maybe lay down (it's too last minute to still mail my con, they don't reply to things in the week beforehand). Going to wear my compression socks with my cosplay regardless of the fact it doesn't match.     

Am I forgetting something? Any tips for when I'm there? I've got ME/CFS and POTS if that helps with giving tips.

Mum got her new electric wheelchair and got a whole new perspective ,"My mum has a few conditions that have led to her mobility worsening over time. For 3 years she's used a rollator with a seat but in order for her to have some autonomy, and ease the stress on her joints for longer journeys/trips out, I bought her an electric wheelchair. It's helped so much already and she can do more with the young kids in our family, like zoo trips etc and also really enjoys going to Ikea again without dealing with the level of exhaustion it used to cause.

In all of this, however, she says she now realises exactly why people who are disabled and use wheelchairs etc feel overlooked and unseen because that's been a lot of her experience so far. People walk out in front of her, block her in at the side of paths, and, as we experienced today in Ikea, think they can push in front of her in queues. 

With this particular situation it affected me a little too as the guy in question skipped both me and my mum in the queue to grab a bag and then proceeded to stand to the side of me, only getting defensive about his position when I pushed our trolley forward towards the tills. He was adamant he was in front until he noticed my mum behind me and only then backed down, not really saying sorry but conceding because he knew what he'd done.

My mum said he'd basically been chasing her down the queueing area but she was faster in her chair. She was still directly behind me and I was the first in the queue, pulled to one side so people could pass to manned tills as I knew I needed to use the self checkout (which was very busy as the people there had a lot of large items) due to social anxiety. 
I just don't understand the audacity. He knew my mum was in front of him, I can understand missing me due to me standing a little off to the side but he still clearly tried to take advantage of the fact my mum is in a wheelchair and thinking she wouldn't bring him up on it. 

I knew it was hard, I have a few people in my life who are ambulatory wheelchair users and I do hear horror stories but as I don't see them often I rarely see it with my own eyes. I'm just sorry this is the way some people are. 

I know queue pushing may seem a silly thing to get upset over but the fact that it seemed like an intentional decision based on the guilt on his face/in his voice is bothering both of us to a degree.

Disabled Characters in Comics. ,"   To let you know my bias up front; I am a long time comics fan. Specifically an X-men fan with my favorite being Professor Xavier, who has off and on been portrayed as being in a wheelchair. 

  In the latest comic in the From The Ashes series of X-men, a new character is introduced. An antagnonist  on the side of the jailers, named “Scurvey”.   Scurvey is portrayed as a hooked-nosed   
and cadaverously thin creature with the aspect of a vulture who walks on elbow length crutches. Clearly both ugly and disabled. 

  Do you feel that this is an example of prejudice against imperfect bodies? Or that heroes need to be   Athletic and beautiful to be heroes?  As disabled people how does Scurvey make you feel?  Finally, do you think that s kid or teen might be reluctant to use a mobility aide like crutches so they aren’t compared to Scurvey?  I am truly interested to hear your thoughts on this.

Thoughts on disability and screen time? ,"My phone screen time is really horrendous. It’s 14 and 1/2 to 16 and 1/2 hours a day on average and it’s been like that for several years. 

I also work from home in front of a laptop screen too for 8 hours a day, obviously a lot of this screen time overlaps with my phone screen time. Generally I listen to YouTube or audiobooks while I’m working and well into the evening too, when I’m resting. It’s very little social media usage, only about half an hour a day. 

I keep seeing lots of advice on technology detox and it does sound really appealing. But with my disability I’m just not sure it’s worth it. A lot of benefits seem to relate to all the other things you can get done, all the goals you can achieve. I have an energy-limiting illness and the vast majority of the benefits are just not achievable for me. If I didn’t watch YouTube or listen to audiobooks I would likely just sit in silence. There would be nothing else. 

What do you think, is a screen time detox still worth doing or is it just denying myself of one of the few things I’m capable of enjoying? ",37,1elv9mc,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1elv9mc/thoughts_on_disability_and_screen_time/,15,1722983373.0

SERIOUS I tend to obsess about worrying if I have an intellectual disability. So much so that it makes me feel awful about myself. Is this me thinking rationally or am I just comparing myself to others at an unhealthy degree?,"This post might be hard to read because I am just throwing out the thoughts in my head as they go. My brain hurts now and it does not feel at least 80% of my intellectual potential today (at least that is how I am categorizing it as I worry I don't have an average level of intelligence anyway) so what I write might not sound coherent or even like something an adult would write. Just bear with me on this.

I don't know if I am intellectually disabled or not. I am autistic and I needed services to help me get by growing up such as special education classes, so that is why I tend to obsess over the possibility of me being intellectually disabled. I managed to graduate high school (even though I was exempt from taking a foreign language class which is something every student needs to take if they are to attend a four-year university which is heavily encouraged by society) and never managed to be held back which sometimes I look back on and think it's amazing I managed to do that, but I still worry that I don't deserve to think I am of at least average intelligence. I had been told that I have a ""learning disability"" but I also know the definition of learning disability differs around the world. Where I live, it means you have difficulty learning the average way, but it does not mean you are intellectually disabled. However, in other parts of the world, learning disabled is just another term for intellectually disabled. I worry about how other people view my disability and me. I worry that I might not have been loved if I had been born into a family of people I like. I obsess over this sort of stuff so much that I will cry myself to sleep at least once a week.

I can't help but notice that people only see value in you if you are at least of average intelligence. People don't respect people who cannot contribute to capitalism and are like every other person. Sometimes I am astounded that being of at least average intelligence is the norm and how different the world would be if the norm was if the common person was intellectually disabled. Every time I hear someone bring up an ableist joke like ""This person must have a low IQ if they do this"" or ""This person is a Darwin candidate"", I tend to think that I must be a definition of that insult. It also goes to more serious issues like if someone talks about how someone has a brain with a flat surface. When someone says that, I start to worry if my brain never went through a pruning process. I also worry I might be afflicted with stuff that might be seen as unrealistic to worry about. I worry that I don't have brain activity even though my typing right now likely means I have some amount of brain activity going on.

I keep hearing people talk about how disabled people shouldn't be allowed to live. Normally they say this for people who have high support needs (which even then, I think everyone regardless of ability or lack there of deserves to live) but some people are more extreme and will say this about people who simply need to be put in a resource class int heir school days or cannot drive in adulthood. Sometimes I worry I might get basic rights taken away from me due to my inabilities. I worry I shouldn't be allowed to eat, drink water, wear clothes, have a place to sleep, have a home to live in, have friends in my life, be allowed to see a doctor if my health is bad, take medications to better myself, or be allowed to learn things. A lot of this is stuff I tend to hear people say disabled people shouldn't have access to due to their mentality that people only deserve basic rights if they have the ability to be worker bees who contribute to capitalism.

Are my worries valid? Is this something many disabled people worry about? Should I get myself tested for an intellectual disability just so I can finally have the answer or would that only make things worse if I know the exact score of my IQ? I honestly want to think that IQ tests are not a reliable way to test someone's intelligence since everyone thinks differently. IQ tests seem to have turned into something that scores someone's worth rather than intelligence because people do not seem to value disabled people.",0,1emidci,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1emidci/serious_i_tend_to_obsess_about_worrying_if_i_have/,5,1723052853.0
I’m just so depressed.,"(Tagged nsfw for possible TW)

I’m just over everything at this point. and im 21.

I’ve always had some sort of health issues. Always sick. Always hurting. Always complaining about something.

I’ve had multiple specialists. Many tests. Imaging. And 90% of that has come back “just fine!” But something’s fucked.

I currently have a Pokémon like list of diagnoses, fibromyalgia, ibs, autism, most likely hEDS, I know I have ulcerative colitis, but doctors don’t listen. And it’s just, ugh.

I can’t function like a fucking human, I can’t move without pain. Any type of noise has a large chance of overstimulating me to the point im just “a bitch”. And the only people who understand all this is my immediate family, which has lead me to become a huge recluse with no friends.

Narcolepsy? ,"I have ME/CFS and dysautonomia for the record. I have this problem where I'll get really sleepy, either randomly from understimulation or as I get too exhausted to stay up any later. I also tend to want to snack before bed. So a secondary issue where I'm falling asleep in the middle of eating a snack.

The most disconcerting thing for me though, is that I will keep eating while asleep. Moving my hands to get more and eating it completely unconscious. And since I'm unconscious, I'm super uncoordinated and I end up with crumbs or entire cheezits or cereal pieces in my lap on the couch and in my shirt. 

Tldr; I often snack before bed and keep eating after falling asleep, and make a mess

Spite as a motivation ,"	I recently came to the realization from another Reddit post about the power of spite as a motivator and a healer. I had long used spite, but this past year I haven’t leaned into it as much. I have almost always had the attitude that if someone told me I couldn’t do something because _________ well “fuck that ima prove them wrong and do it anyways.”
	Even before my diagnosis as a young child, I had that attitude. One such story that occurs to me is when I was young I was visiting another family member and they had this huge lake in their backyard. Now from what I’ve been told apparently my grandpa had told me I couldn’t paddle the kayak across the lake. So little me decided I would paddle it almost all the way through the lake, and on my way back my grandpa came out and I told him how he said I couldn’t cross the lake but I did cross the lake. (Yes I had a life jacket.) Or something to that effect. 
Now when I look back at when I was diagnosed and after my second hospitalization I carried the I will prove them wrong in moments of doubt. First when after my first hospitalization at which I was told I had Schizophrenia (although this would change to schizoaffective) I was told I was too coherent to have schizophrenia. After that when I doubted my verbal ability I would remind myself that I would prove him wrong about schizophrenics not being coherent by writing the best essay.
Then my second hospitalization which has many things to write about surrounding it, I will focus on some of what I was told. I remember being told I’d have to go to residential school because they didn’t think I could make it through high school at home. They also mentioned at one point wanting to send me to the state hospital. In high school as I would often doubt myself and remember that I’d say fuck that I will graduate.
I feel like recently though I haven’t had as much of the I will prove them wrong attitude. Which I think hasn’t helped me much. I think it would be a good thing for me to go back to seeing the doomerish statements as a challenge because I will remember those statements and have moments of doubt often where I find myself slipping into the patterns of self-loathing when instead seeing those statements as a challenge seems to be more helpful.

Unum ,"After two months of going back and forth, Unum finally approved my long term disability a week ago. 

I’m under care for cancer. Ongoing side effects, chemo, I’m sick way more often than I’m healthy. My work actually requested that I apply for disability and stop working until I start feeling better and my appointments slowed down. I was assured this would be an easy process. Obviously I know now that was a lie…

But anyway, I need advice. Unum approved my disability on 7/30. Since then I’ve been told that my case is with the finance department. Every day I’m told the same thing. Finance dept is reviewing my case, payment will be released by end of day. I don’t even know my payment amount. I need to be paid… bills are stacking up, I have prescriptions to purchase, fridge is empty… my kids start school next week and we’ve purchased nothing. 

What’s the secret to get them to pay me?

I was on long term disability late 23, early 24 and my pay was a little over $3000 a month. I received a raise when I went back to work for a few months. By my calculations they owe me at least $6000 and counting. That’s a lot of money for me at least.

I'm on a waitlist of a physo and when i get a appotment i will be getting brases and hopefully a mobility aid, but im not 100% sure if im in bad enough of a condtion.

summary: more pain less stablilty wondering if I'm bad enough to require a mobility aid.

"Cripping-Up, Authentic Disability Portrayal and Disabled Actors","A few weeks ago I started searching for information about disabled actors and authentic casting and portrayal and was disappointed at how hard it was to find this information, so I've created a few lists that you might find interesting.  
I was surprised by the amount of disabled and neurodivergent actors I found. Most lists included people who are long since dead (RIP), non-actors like Elon Musk (I know, WTF!), and actors where there is speculation that they have a condition but no declaration.  
I found quite a few movies where there was cripping-up involved, and some great examples of movies and shows where disabled actors were cast for authenticity. I found over 130 of these and I'm still looking for more.  
I'm going to continue developing these lists as a resource for anyone looking for examples or is simply curious, and if you have any suggestions for additions or amends, that would be appreciated.  
There's also some blurb about statistics that I've pulled together because there is a lot of misinformation, especially when it comes to drama.

[**Disability Portrayal. The Fails and The Wins**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls541946286/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) which is a list of 20 good and bad practice and I've annotated it with an explainer for each one. What went well, what didn't go so well and where appropriate what they could do better next time.

[**Movies with Disabled Characters that if remade would benefit from Authentic Disability Casting** ](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls541869888/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk)is a list that has lots of examples where non-disabled actors took roles that could have been cast authentically. It's not the actor's fault because like the rest of us they have bills to pay, but for the recent examples, directors have issues with authentic casting that maybe need to be addressed.

[**British and American Disabled and Neurodivergent Actors**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls541662041/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) are included in this list and are all checked out. They have all openly spoken about their conditions and are all professional actors (no cameos here thank you), and are all alive. I could have added names like Christopher Reeve or Esmond Knight, but I didn't which makes me thing that maybe I should create a historical list too.  
If you are only interested in [**Visibly Disabled Actors**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls541464229/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) or [**Neurodivergent Actors**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls545872590/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) then I have created separate list for each of them.

[**TV Shows and Movies that Cast Disabled Actors**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls543372245/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) came about from looking at the work of the visibly disabled actors I was finding. This is all about visible disability portrayal, whether it is authentic and relates to a story or is incidental where disability adds subtext.

[**Disability Portrayal, 101 Great Examples (in pictures)**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls541454496/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) is more of a fun stroll through what I have found looking for examples where casting for visible disability is authentic, the storyline is not offensive (comments please) and where there is best practice in terms of casting, writing, performance and directing. Some of these have more than one image, because the IMDB pages have them, and there are some notable absences as there are no images included in IMBD, so apologies if your favourite show is not there, they just might not have published any images of the disabled actors.

Please let me know what you think and I hope you have as much fun as I have exploring the work of disabled actors and disability storytelling.",16,1elei8z,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1elei8z/crippingup_authentic_disability_portrayal_and/,2,1722940957.0

"Seeking information/advice on a couple different topics regarding marriage, disability, and income.","**Background:**

I have a neuromuscular disability, am a DAC (disabled adult child), with a rare disease, and qualify for care about 11 hrs a day, being dressed, bathed, transferred, toileted, housecare, etc. I've been dating my boyfriend online for going on five years now. I live in Maine (USA), and he lives in Scotland (UK). We're at the point where we'd like to progress to the next stage of life, however because of my disability it's very hard for me to just up and move. It's also difficult for him because he's in another country so he can't just move here and stay without going through the proper processes. I am currently on SSI (retirement) which I believe I get from my father, and also SS disability I believe. I have medicare part A and B.

**Scenario/Questions:**

Boyfriend via ESTA visits USA from UK, can we get married and he applies for adjustment of status after? What are things we should be aware of or look out for if we do this? I know we would probably be over the yearly income limit for my state, but only barely, which means I'd lose some of my benefits I assume, but it would be hard paying out of pocket I assume for the kind of insurance I need. Is there a way around this?

Is my boyfriend visiting and us immediately getting married the best way to go about it? We don't really want or have the time to wait on a long process of a K1 visa. We know we're ready to marry, and just want to begin the process while he visits on an ESTA visa. Could the government send him home before his adjustment of marriage status goes through? How long could that take and what are the downsides? Is there an appeal we could make if that happens, since leaving me without him or other care services - which might be removed if we were to marry, would put me in a vulnerable position?

If my boyfriend has money saved in his bank account, how will US/UK taxes affect him moving here and getting married? How can he avoid being taxed out the bum?

Any and all advice regarding any of the topics or anything I didn't mention but you think might be helpful for me would be appreciated.

Lastly, **thank you** ahead of time for any and all advice and help. Everyone's situation is different, ours is a bit complicated, so we're both very overwhelmed, when this should really be a happy time in our lives. So any and all help is appreciated. <3",1,1elz8xi,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1elz8xi/seeking_informationadvice_on_a_couple_different/,6,1722994129.0
Looking for Experience/Tips from Individuals With Disabilities/Injuries Affecting Their Legs,"My father in law recently had a very tragic accident resulting in multiple surgeries on his back and a significant change in his lifestyle.

The doctor diagnosed him with a grade A spinal cord injury. He does not have motor or sensory function below the level of injury. He cannot urinate or defecate without assistance (himself or others).

I am hoping to get some advice from those that have similar situations (inability to function from the waist down). 

- What helped with depressive symptoms and motivation to adapt?

- What tools do you use to make it easier? What are the resources you can’t imagine going without?

- What are the biggest challenges you have had?

- What is the best way to support him?

We really want him to feel like the man he used to feel like. We want him to know how useful and amazing he still is and how much he can do.

Bonus if you’re willing to create a short video with some advice or support for my father in law. His name is Dave. My email is limitedxsin@aim.com. 

Thank you all for your time.

LFG is killing me faster than my disability ,"I was on STD with Lincoln, it was great and had no issues, now that my issues have carried over causing me to go into LTD, it’s been absolute hell.

Hi! New comer question,"So.. This is going to sound dumb, please don't judge me, but am I ""disabled enough? ""

I was born with knee caps that don't sit in the groove/sit higher up (both knees). Since 7th grade (3-4 years ago) they dislocate a lot and cause me pain when walking for long distances, or more than 15 minutes. I've had surgery on my left one, and currently use a rollator and walker to get around. I'm doing better with my left leg, but feel more secure and safe when using the rollator. It makes me feel like I can have support and a safe way to walk long periods. 

But my mom doesn't want me to be ""that disabled"". She believes I wouldn't want to be 18 and still on a rollator. It really hurt me, because it gives me support on bad days. I also feel like I can't call myself disabled because of other ableist things my mom has said about me or other disabled people. But I want to be able to find a label and community that fits me.

"allergies (again) // cw | medical fatphobia, ED ment","hi, old man returns to yell at clouds (/FoS)

i'm stewing abt my situation of being allergic to fruit (among other foods) because i'm allergic to latex again, and smthn that's been happening semi-related to it is peeving me just a lil bit. last i was here, i said that i had plans to go to the doctor and get a referral to an allergist and i ended up missing that appointment. i was exhausted bc of a 3am cleaning burst ep, my gran (who is my pseudo-caregiver and is also disabled) was exhausted from her night-shift job, and the appointment was at 9:45am,, safe to say, i was a dunce for accepting one that early and thinking ""yeah, this 'll be fine""

now, i know i need to go back and get a new appointment but smthn is kinda nagging at me and making me procrastinate. as considerate and open minded as my doctor is, thank gods, she also has a lil habit of suggesting weight loss medication as an alternative to what i actually need/want. she's nvr pushed it past the 1st ""do you want x or to go ahead w/ y?"" but it's happened more than once and ik it'll happen again.

i will give that she's not entirely asking w/out reason. i'm over 300 lbs and have hEDS + POTS, being overweight can/does make those conditions worsen quicker. however, she seemingly fails to accept the reasons why i'm not losing weight as i should be is bc a) i can't properly exercise w/ hEDS + POTS and b) she doesn't ask abt my history w/ disordered eating. i have ARFID, had BED and OSFED, lactose intolerance, vinegar intolerance, and now a growing latex fruit allergy checkbox list. if you didn't know, despite what sm claim, limited eating does NOT help w/ losing weight in the long run. at one point, before my dx, i /was/ working out and had a three week streak in my routine. do yk how much weight i lost? up to FIVE lbs a week. that's how bad it was.

(extreme weight-loss is considered to be between two to 2.5 a week !!)

but does she know /any/ of this? NO !! she hasn't asked and is only looking at the numbers on my charts /now/ !! i just started (a couple yrs ago now) repairing my relationship w/ food and working on ways to eat better; espec now that i /know/ i have hEDS and POTS, which require vitamin/nutrient supplements to make up for my bone and blood content lacking. i understand her concern, both as a medical professional and smn who is plus sized herself; however, she's not looking at any full picture.

i /will/ be making a new appointment bc i actually do need to be referred, but there will be words to be had if this is brought up again !!",0,1elw7yc,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1elw7yc/allergies_again_cw_medical_fatphobia_ed_ment/,8,1722985826.0

"Need help with ADA - Anxiety, Depression, Hypertension","I am applying for a reasonable accommodation at work, (I am a contractor for local government) at my doctor's suggestion. My doctor wrote up paperwork asking that I work a hybrid schedule due to panic attacks, hypertension, and debilitating anxiety. My employer has turned it down saying that there's nothing relating to in-office work which qualifies me for an accommodation. My doctor is stumped on how to fill out the paperwork, he told me he's never have someone's ADA denied before.

I have been suffering from debilitating anxiety and depression for the last 6 years, and the hypertension has gotten worse in the last 2 years; currently on 4 meds and I am still at stroke level BP. When I do WFH, my BP is lower, I can control the lights to take care of vision issues, and can rest when needed. My panic attacks are much less frequent as well. My panic attacks have increased in frequency in the last 6 months. I've had quite a few in front of co workers which is extremely embarrassing. When I am at home, I am more in control of my environment and it's better for my anxiety; I have extreme anxiety about work place violence and danger while commuting.

I'm not quite sure how to put this all on paper. Everyone at work sees that I need this, HR doesn't. My co workers are trying to see how they can help get this approved.

Does anyone know what magic terms I can put on my ADA form to get this approved? It's so frustrating because I have legitimate disabilities, and it just seems like HR doesn't care.

Could use some advice.,"I had a stroke almost 3 years ago that left me unable to drive, or work at my 20+ year long career. I was a field tech working on fire alarm systems. If I wasn't installing them, I was repairing them, and occasionally helping the inspection team when I had nothing else going on. For a few reasons, I absolutely love that work, and I've been holding out some hope that my ""gift"" left to me by my stroke killing a part of my brain that I would be able to get back to it. But it's been almost 3 years, and things haven't gotten any better. I only *look* better because I am actively attempting to make myself look better. I'm better at hiding what's wrong in my head, and my body. I can't work anywhere that requires me to drive to and from an office, so that means that pretty much everything in my previous line of work is a no-go. 

I can't drive, my balance is almost non-existent, and I have been given the ""*best""* gift of all: a permanent hallucination of the world literally shifting in front of me. The stroke left me with a never-ending case of **bad** vertigo, with everything included. I feel off balance all the time, I stopped driving before my doctor even realized to make sure I didn't drive or really use any kind of tools, like the power tools used at work. I have found new work, in a completely different field (Hard to have something in the same field that can be done 100% on a computer from home), and what really seems to get at me is that I'm angry just thinking of working there. Not so much angry, as sad, I guess, about the fact that I will likely never be able to go back to what I love doing again, and I can't seem to really put forth the effort needed for my new job.

Has anybody else had this happen? How did you get past it, if I can ask? I'm honestly just wanting to find a way to move on and stop being so damned bitter all the time. I would love any feedback. If anybody has questions about me, or what happened in my brain while I slept, just ask and I'll answer the best I can. I appreciate any and all advice, recommendations, Etc.

Partner has a problem with my sleeping habits,"I need some advice about my boyfriend of almost 7 years (we both don’t want to be married in general). What are your opinions about your partner having a problem with your sleeping habits? Backstory: I have chronic pancreatitis, epilepsy, trigeminal neuralgia, and hypothyroidism. I’ve been on SSDI since before we were together. We’ve actually known each other since high school so he knows that I have health challenges. We also have a 5 year old autistic daughter. Currently I go to bed between 11pm-12am (he likes to say remarks when I try to go to bed earlier so sometimes I stay up to avoid it) and our daughter wakes up anywhere between 4am - 7am everyday. Since I don’t work I get up with her. She goes to Aba mon-Thurs and while she’s gone I’ll take anywhere from a 30min-2hr nap depending on how I feel. I do the housework daily. He works from home so he’ll see me nap and wake me up. Or say a mean comment later on. He says I sleep enough and that I shouldn’t be tired. Tonight we got into an argument because I decided to lay down in bed around 8 and I fell asleep after 9pm the night before. He said I’ve always been the one to sleep too much throughout our entire relationship and that I’ll never change. And that if tables were reversed then women would be calling him a piece of shit, etc. I ended the conversation after that. I don’t have any friends because I stay home from not feeling well most of the time. My mother just died in May so my main support system is gone. I’m just lost. Thank you in advance.

Help... I don't know how to control my conditions,"I already am seeing a therapist, but due to insurance and money reasons I have to see them once a month (it's a $35 copay for every visit). 

Without making this too long, I have the following conditions:

• Autism
• ADHD
• OCD
• GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Yes I have both OCD and GAD)
• DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)
• Major Depressive Disorder


How the fuck do I help myself with all these conditions... Autism and OCD are destroying me. I can't control my actions and thoughts half of the time. I do things on a whim without thinking and even if I do think before doing actions, I still do them because something compells me too. The symptoms from my OCD are killing my self-esteem and self-confidence. I don't want to do anything because I think I'm not good enough. 

I'm not trying to get pity out of anyone. I deserve everything. However, I don't know how to manage anything. Autism is causing me to have fake emotions and think I'm feeling a certain emotion when I am actually feeling another (Example: My brain makes me think I'm happy when instead I could be overstimulated, so it leads to aggravation, short-temper, and others). 

If anyone wants more information on a certain condition and how it affects me, please let me know

I’m 19F, in ireland. I broke my spine last year. Car crash. My doctor and the hospital staff were medically negligent. To cut it short, my back didn’t heal right and every single day my spine has been made of broken glass, my mental health is the lowest it’s ever been, and it’s been low, and I gained a lot of weight (130 pounds to now 195 pounds in 4 months) and I’ve big purple stretch marks all over me that I’ll never be able to remove. 

Me and my fiancée (21F) got curious 1 day last year and decided we’d try recreational drugs. We tried weed before in our childhood and early teens (bad cousins) and it was just boring. So we tried HHC gummies, and my god, it’s the best feeling in the world. Once a week, sometimes 2 or 3 times, we take about 0.5-2.5mg of it each, I’ve never felt pain on it. I feel good, I feel happy, I’m not suicidal anymore, I’m incredibly creative and inspiring, I enjoy life. 

I’m in no way addicted to it, matter of fact it’s been 2 weeks since we had it cuz we ran out. The store is 2 hours away and just annoying to go to so we sometimes just don’t.

Tired of Isolation Advice lies,"IDK what this is, I think its a rant more than anything but I'm tired of being lied to when I bring up my feelings. I'm in a wheelchair and this has led to extreme isolation and whenever I meet people new its always like theres a wall between me and them, like theyre even scared to speak to me. I always thought it was just me but i never have this problem speaking to people online and I think anyone previously fat or ugly can confirm just how differently people sub-consciously treat you, so i honestly feel like its just the chair that scares people off at this point. My problem really is just that when I bring this up, I always get a variation of the response ""Those aren't people you wanna hang out with anyway, you dodged a bullet"" Or when I give a little pushback the ""truth"" comes out and I get something like ""Yeah man it sucks, youre gonna have it harder, but I know a guy in a wheelchair that has hundreds of friends"" which then makes me laugh because some of these people have told me im the only guy in a wheelchair they know in the past. Obviously down stream from this is dating too and its a similar story ""you dodged a bullet, women like that are terrible anyway"". Yeah man I'm really glad ive dodged all these bullets, leaving me almost completely alone, having never been a on a date with my only friends being the ones I made in elementary when we as humans dgaf about looks like this. I've tried making friends with people who have disabilities too but everyone I've met tends to care about disability almost as much as average people do, though I won't lie I've met \*some\* nice people. Usually, if they the type to care about disability, they give out the line that its just logistically easier with able-bodied people to hang out, so theyd rather not even get to know you for some reason. When you go downstream to dating dating disabled people its the same problem, people seem to want nothing to do with you (Maybe a different story in LGBT circles but im speaking from straight male perspective) Again, everyone then gives off the line that its easier with able-bodied people, as if you don't just care about these abled bodied people you hang out with or date, but they have to serve the purpose of being an impromptu care giver for you too. Most of the aforementioned guys I met up with to just make friends haven't been on a date either like me which doesn't help the isolation and feeling I'll never be loved by anyone too. I guess at the end of the day I am lucky to still have the group of friends I made as a kid which is more than a lot of disabled folks can say, but it hurts that  it feels no one else will ever care to get to know me.

Idk why I even wrote this, I just want to get the frustration out when it feels like people know I am fucked but the best they can give me is a little lie with a confident smile on their face, sorry for the abrupt end and incoherent writing structure..",8,1el3f08,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1el3f08/tired_of_isolation_advice_lies/,5,1722902716.0

Any advice for a disabled adult living with problematic family that won't stay out of your personal affairs?,"Hello! Hoping this is the right place, kinda looking for some support here, or input? 25 afab enby, about to be 26 here! POTS, CFS, Fibro, and suspected EDS, among many others.

So, I live with my parents, currently trying to get SSI and still chasing down unexplained symptoms, you know, the ordeal. I've been trying to gain independence for quite some time. Point is, actively trying to get out.

My folks have only recently recognized that I am actually, truly disabled, and not just making things up to get out of things. I'm glad they finally did, but they, mainly my mother, still treat me as if I am not an adult. Mind you, I pay for my own food, belongings, everything I own and use, but cannot do utilities or rent just yet. I have two partners (26 amab both) who help care for me and visit frequently to help or hang out. My folks do not know we are all dating due to past bad behavior at other partners. This is where the trouble starts to come in.

For a long while we all used to share my room and sleep together. This wasn't a problem initially. The previous mentioned bad behavior was directed at my last partner for staying with me, and my mother forbidding that, and proceeding to cause further issues during his (now her) stay, even when abiding by that rule. Now, one of my aunts, her sister, got divorced and had to move in with us for a while. This is totally fine, I like her, she likes me and both my partners. I even like her being here, and she isn't the issue directly. When she was younger she had the reputation for being the family gossip, but has grown since then. My mother is actually the issue here. She has placed a rule that my partners and I cannot sleep in the same room while my aunt is here, citing that she worries that my aunt will go tell their mother, my highly religious grandmother, and start problems like that. I have been abiding by this too, as it was only supposedly going to be 3 months. We are coming up on month 5.

The reason this is an issue is because they stay here to help me with physical labor that I can't do myself. And we do not have an appropriate place for them to sleep. They sleep on the couches in the family room. All of us are nocturnal, one of them working the night shift. So besides the couches being too short and narrow for them both (each of them over 6ft tall,) they are not only in the room that gets the full force of the rising sun through the very large windows that disrupts their sleep, they also get woken up by everyone being in that area in the mornings. They wake up with little to no sleep, usually in pain, and aren't in the condition to help me. Obviously I also miss sleeping with them as they both only have twin beds at their places, and little to no privacy. It just sucks. I also believe my aunt will be here far longer than stated, as they have been prettying up the place for themselves quite extensively.

So why don't I try to talk to my mother about it? Unfortunately my mother has narcissistic personality disorder (and unsurprisingly won't get help for it.) All conversations I have ever had with her expressing needs or wishes that make her even slightly uncomfortable always resulted in her blowing up and making things worse as a result. Usually full of insults, threats, or yelling. My father won't back me up either, as he won't ever go against her, and is a passive enabler. He simply won't even if he disagrees with her. I also said she ""cited"" the worry about my grandmother as her motive because she frequently will do that and have an ulterior motive that she doesn't want to mention because it puts her bad faith on display. She has jealousy issues over the people I have in my life and has said as such many times outright. She's also stated (during my ex-girlfriend's stay) that she doesn't get to sleep next to anyone (folks are separated) so ""why should you get to?"" I don't know, I just worry that there's an unsaid second reason she imposed this new rule.

So I'm unsure what to even do in this situation. I have a couple options that I can see, but none are particularly good ones. I could do what I did that allowed them to be sleeping in here in the first place, which is just doing it and acting as if that's totally normal and business as usual, which it kinda is to be fair. I could go ask my aunt if them sleeping in here would bother her, and politely ask her to not mention it to my grandmother, as I believe she'd be very reasonable about it, but even if I don't mention my mother's motive, she would very possibly view that as throwing her under the bus or usurping her in some way. I could go speak with my father about it again, but that wouldn't really produce any results as the response will be ""I won't go against your mother.""

I dunno I'm really lost. I have mixed feelings on the validity of my feelings on the issue, or right to have adult privileges in the house I have to live in until I can finally get out, whenever that is. I feel like I should have some boundaries about what goes on in my private area, but I'm unsure. I get that I live with them, and I'm grateful for that, but I still feel like I have no say what goes on in my own life.

Sorry for the long read, or rant? I just have a lot of context and complicated moving parts in all this. I appreciate any polite feedback, or advice, or simple understanding. Thanks for reading.

Edit for extra clarity: My mother does not pay any of the bills either. My father owns the house, and pays for  everything, and only barely. Even her own personal bills like her insurance and her credit cards, and personal shopping he pays for. I guess that's what really bothers me about it. It's just frustrating to be beneath someone who contributes the same amount I do. I would get it if my father also agreed with this rule, but he doesn't. He understands and agrees with me, but as stated, won't stop her. He won't tell on me, but he won't back me up either. At the end of the day, I can always just wait.",0,1elqrpv,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1elqrpv/any_advice_for_a_disabled_adult_living_with/,9,1722972466.0
I have trouble managing caregivers ," I've been managing my care staff for 18 years and I still stink at it. I have 2 caregivers, one is great at her job and the other sucks at it but he's my only friend in a part of the country where I have no family. The problem is that the good caregiver is rightfully tiered of cleaning up after the bad caregiver. I would hate to lose the good caregiver over something I should have prevented. I feel even worse that I upset the good caregiver, she deserves better than that. Now I just have anxiety when either one is working. I told the bad one I already ate because I don't want him to mess up the kitchen. My problem is that I don't expect much from anyone. Some people take advantage of that while others don't.

Recap of Disabled Voters for Kamala Harris,"Hello everyone!

This is a recap of the zoom meeting Disabled Voters for Kamala Harris that happened last Friday (sorry for the delay). I've never done a recap post before, so I'm not sure exactly how specific I should be? I'm happy to answer any more specific questions down below.

The meeting was two hours long with a five minute intermission. Pretty much the whole thing was ASL-interpreted, but there were many technical difficulties on that end with the interpreters disappearing, the squares being two small for one of the Deaf speakers to see, etc. Some others also mentioned that although there were subtitles they were very delayed and overall not that helpful. However, they mentioned this is going to be a first of a series of meetings, so hopefully they will be able to work the kinks out.

This meeting did *not* discuss policy or what we want from Kamala Harris. Rather, it was more of a pep rally emphasizing the importance of voting (and specifically, voting for Harris over the man who says he wants people with ID/DDs to die). There were two separate panels, each of whom were asked a couple of questions in regards to voting. Among the things that were discussed were the difficulties disabled people can run into while voting and how people can be aware of and be ready to confront those barriers. It was suggested that we visit the polling place ahead of time to see if it's accessible to us, voting in groups, and overall 'Karen-ing' the poll workers until they let us vote. They also discussed how to report non-ADA compliant polling stations.

Something that was repeatedly emphasized was intersectionality, and that they didn't have anyone on their panel who was Asian, and only had one man. As such, they encourage anyone interested in the panel to reach out and contact them at [info@disabledvotersforharris.com](mailto:info@disabledvotersforharris.com).

There will be further meetings in which Harris' policy regarding disability will be discussed.",3,1el6f3p,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1el6f3p/recap_of_disabled_voters_for_kamala_harris/,0,1722911250.0
Disability? mentally ill,"Im really sorry i have no idea where to ask. Im a 25f with a diagnosis of : PTSD, BPD, Bipolar ii, GAD, recurrent MDD, OCD. The only reason i made jt this far in life is bc i never had an option. I am self supporting and on top of having to send money to my family. I have a full time job (hourly $45.32) and a minimum wage part time job (CA-16$)that im trying to use for debt. One reason rn i cant end things bc i have no health insurance i cant afford due to debt so i worry that i will be found and have to suffer even more humiliation and pain since as i understand most attempts are unsuccessful 

I was on medication for almost 7ish years before eventually stopping because i thought i was finally at a good place in my life but alas.

I debated for so many years about going on disability because im not sure what else to say other than i just have a hadd time functioning especially at work. One of the main reasons i stop myself every time is bc i heard its 1.2k a month or so which doesnt cover my expenses not even close. Im talking like bills and car and debt etc. if it were up to me, i am willing to live in dumpster eating noodles if that meant i can feel less pain and dont have to daydream abt ending as often as i do.

I am trying to understand what are my options as to disability and is mental illness covered i just have no idea what to do and im desperate enough because frankly it feels like im at my deathbed .

The ableism in criminal “justice”,"I’m into true crime and I’m watching the case of Jane Bashara. She was killed by a guy named Joe Gentz with a 67 IQ (he’s developmentally disabled) and they didn’t take him seriously at all when Joe said that Jane’s husband, Bob Bashara, hired him and Bob helped him dispose of Jane’s body… because he has “the mind of a child”. Joe even said that Bob was pointing a gun at his head to make *sure* he killed Jane. 

They didn’t believe a word he said, and then it turns out, as they investigated more… Joe was right.

I tried to point out to my mom that they were being ableist, but she refused to see it. They were trying to use him as a scapegoat and everything. I hope the police felt like assholes when they realized Joe was being honest.

Things are looking better and worse ,"
I have constant pain in my entire body. My knees give out regularly. I get vomiting spells, severe constipation. It hurts to pee and I get regular UTIs. I get horrible headache and migraines.ive had seizures in the past. I can't sleep well or lift anything. I have a irregular period my cycles (30-70 days) I also have bipolar and autism.

I've been dealing with all this for a long time and managed to get help hear and thare but it's very difficult to get doctors to take my pain and other issues seriously. 
I very recently have managed to get a lot of care for these long term problems.

I have a psychiatrist, PCP, urologist, dietitian, physical therapist, neurologist, and a GURD Dr.

My psychiatrist is pretty good as well as my PT. My PT has had me bring things up to my PCP and she puts in referrals that take months or years.i got my urologist 2 years after I got put on the wait list. He is good I guess. He put in a standing order for UTI testing so I don't have to go to urgent care.

My dietitian is nice but ineffective. She makes suggestions and recommendations that I just can't afford to follow though on. I am living Off of my SSDI and my boyfriends small paychecks. I've tried explaining this but I guess she just doesn't get it. 

My GURD Dr. Just straight up gaslights me. Downplaying my systems and saying I'm probably just stressed. He as implied that I'm just being dramatic on multiple occasions. But I've gone a month without pooping before. He doesn't offer any solutions he just tells me I'm fine. 

I just got a new neurologist I've only seen him once and he got more done in 1 visit than my previous neurologist got done in 3 years. 

I'm on wait lists for rheumatology, therapy, orthopedics, a medical breast reduction, and the fertility clinic. 

Even though I am getting care more than ever before I'm still in a lot of pain and struggling in life. I have been struggling with my PT exercises at home became of my pain just being to severe. I can't have a real social life because of my pain and lack of a license. I just see family and my pets. I talk to some of my friends online and I see them once a year or two. 

It's just hard especially since no one around me really gets it.

Aitah,"So just to start off, I have disabled family members, friends, co-workers, partner and now I work exclusively with Adults with learning disabilities.

My friends that have little to no experience with folk with disabilities think I'm awful for saying this so I want to know your opinion.

""People with disabilities can be assholes too.""

They say things like ""you can't talk about disabled people like that"" or ""don't say something so awful"". What is your opinion on this? 

My stance is,  just because you have a disability does not mean you can't do or say awful things. 

For example, there's a women who uses a wheelchair where I live and she is so rude, mean and awful to everyone around her and she abused her dog to the point where it had to be taken from her. I have been nothing but, kind, understanding and helpful to this woman but yet she still says some truly horrible things to me. She only has a physical disability and is fully aware of her actions. She's an asshole 100% but I can't say that as she's in a wheelchair?

AITA for leaving a group because someone had autism?,"I (now 21F) was in an anime club hosted by my college a couple years ago. The first year in it was good, I got along fairly well with most of the people and even went to a convention (my first ever anime convention at that). I had a blast and planned on joining them the next year despite being close to graduating thanks to college classes I took in high school.

During the first convention there was an guy (M unknown age) with autism that I didn’t exactly like but was willing to be civil with. He wasn’t someone that required around the clock support and could have regular conversations with but I figured we just weren’t people that would be friends. However, he had a tendency to try and get me annoyed by doing a ridiculous Irish impression *constantly* and only one person (age and exact gender unknown) in the group could make him stop.

It turns out he kept himself managed because of that person and when they left he became a lot worse. He was constantly “play” fighting with two of the other autistic guys (both of which I get along fine with) so roughly that they had to ban it or risk getting kicked out of the group with some other restrictions that honestly made the group a bit dull.

What makes it worse is that I’ve seen him completely keep himself from doing anything “weird” when with his mother. While I’m aware of masking (ADHD diagnosis for myself) it’s infuriating to me that he can’t at least acknowledge that when asked to stop doing something he should apologize.

I did end up going to the second anime convention with the group despite this and I wish i hadn’t. On the last day, right before a group picture, he stole the glasses from another group member who uses a cane. I offered to get them back and had to grab his arm to try and reach since he is quite a bit taller than me. He grabbed me back and squeezed my arm so hard I started to cry (admittedly my pain tolerance is low but I bruised and had to get an ice pack wrapped against my arm).

This was my last straw, so when we came back home I stopped visiting the anime club. I saw some of the members that were in other clubs, and even got a message about his actions and what was changing in the future. However, I can’t bring myself to go back.

Edit:
I would like to say that he explained his actions away using his autism for an explanation. I’m aware there are different levels of autism, such as needing full support due to being unable to speak and/or read without assistance, and was concerned I just wasn’t aware what his needs actually were after seeing him acting so differently around certain people.",53,1ekgj8d,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ekgj8d/aita_for_leaving_a_group_because_someone_had/,39,1722837727.0

I feel EXTRAORDINARILY hopeful for the first time since 2018 and it's making me off balance. ,"I have been having between 1 to 3 spine surgeries a year for the past six years and unknown pain before that. I just had a surgery two weeks ago and I'm hopeful it's working. Most things on my body have to been done bilaterally, so it's likely the shifted pain to my right side will have to have surgery in the next year or two. But right now, the pain on my left side is down for the first time in six years. 

I'm dreaming about all the things I used to do when my pain was lower, meanwhile I'm on mostly bedrest recouping from surgery for at least the next 6 weeks for fusion to begin. My pain will never be zero, but lower was the goal for this surgery. And lower seems to be accomplished. 

It's 3 months before I'll be able to really feel a change and 12 months until imaging confirmation. But that's seems like nothing for a problem that started in 2008 and wasn't figured out until 2018.

23F seeking to gain independence from toxic relationship ,"Hey everyone! I recently made a post about being in a tough situtation, here’s the link to that post: https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/s/dU3xcro2kS

(tldr: in a toxic relationship, no support outside of him, needing to gain independence to possibly break up) 


I’ve concluded that I need to start putting all of my spoons into gaining as much independence as I can, however that’s really hard with my situation. I’m so disabled currently that I can’t really drive, and I have absolutely no friends or family whatsoever that can support me. 

I’m seeking any resources, advice, or information on how to gain as much independence as I can. Currently, my boyfriend is my only source of financial support, and I would be homeless without him. I am also seeking advice or resources on ways to build my support circle. If I do end things with my partner, I will have absolutely zero people in my life. 

I am looking for any ways to make money within my ability, any online jobs, any legit resources for disabled people, or any hacks or ideas I haven’t thought of. For a little more context, my disabilities limit my ability to focus, be around others, and leave my home more than once a week or so. I have:

 • PTSD  
• Panic disorder
• generalized anxiety disorder 
• Major depressive disorder 
• Autism 
• Chronic fatigue syndrome 
• Auditory processing disorder 
• sensory processing disorder 
• Insomnia 
• Misophonia 

My disabilities are so bad that many days I feel like I’m just straight up dying.

I can not drive and rely entirely on Uber or my partner for any transportation. 

I am currently waiting for my disability case to be approved, and have been waiting for over a year now with no sign of anything yet. And yes, I’m in therapy but my partner pays for all my sessions. 
 I should also add that due to my disabilities I have not had the change to obtain a college degree.

If they invite you in, do you tell them in advance, “Hey, I use a walker and a captioning device since I’m hearing impaired”? I don’t see myself leaving a fully-remote role for a “hybrid” one but may take the interview just for practice. 

For reference, I don’t exactly live in the most progressive area of the country. This is a place where some people get VERY angry if they see someone in a spinal brace, mobility aid, etc.

Advice on getting Medicaid to cover Mobility aids,"So I have Medicare and Medicaid. I guess it's whatever the first insurance doesn't cover, the second will pick up. I'm also on disability and unemployed so my income is very limited. 

So far I've been able to afford the cane I needed since they wouldn't cover it and the wheelchair I had to save up for a wheelchair ($145 Drive Blue Streak) since insurance wouldn't cover that either. Weirdly they didn't say they wouldn't cover it because it wasn't for indoor use specifically but the woman at the pharmacy said it's because they rarely cover wheelchairs for people who aren't elderly or bed ridden. I also found my Nana's old walker that I've using but it's really bad quality since it was got to just get her through a two week stay at our house. 

These things get me through fine but my wheelchair is so bulky and heavy it tires me out just getting it around and my doctor recently prescribed me a rollator since I was just diagnosed with POTS. 

I have Fibromyalgia, CFS, and POTS and I'm wondering if that's why I'm having issues with getting insurance to accept the prescriptions. The pharmacy I was going to go to as well was wanting to charge me $250 just to rent a transport wheelchair (not the kind I need) and IF medicaid approved it, I'd be reimbursed $99 for the transport wheelchair I have no use for. So I'm trying to see about getting Mobility aids myself and billing insurance to get them to cover it that way, if it can work that way. I'm not sure, I'm very new to this all having just been diagnosed in January and only a couple weeks ago did I find out that insurance tends to fight you on it when it comes to coverage.

My questions are:

How do I even start?

How do I know if they'll cover specific mobility aids? Like what if they don't think the brand is reliable and choose to deny it? How do I prevent that?

Is there like a budget I should stay in for these things? Are there ones they would deem too expensive for my needs?

Sorry for all the text and questions. I'm really new to this and I have autism and learning disabilities so understanding all this stuff has been so hard for me so help would be much appreciated! I'm just mostly overwhelmed on where to even start.

Edit : Wanted to add this since my comments and post are getting down voted, my doctor it seems like has zero idea on what the process is for getting mobility aids. From what she's been saying, it made it seem like I just bring script into a specific pharmacy and it would be just filled there like any other script. 

I joined this sub because I have been disabled due to severe mental health issues since I was 15 but I have only had mobility issues since January of this year. I have no one who knows what they're doing on my care team honestly and I'm still even going through the diagnosing process. I just got diagnosed with POTS a few days ago and we're still suspicious I have early stages of Rheumatoid arthritis even though I tested negative (my grandma has it and tested negative too) so I'm still figuring things out. 

I know this stuff may be common sense to many who have dealt with being physically disabled for longer than I but I am basically on my own in all this and trying to figure it all out without any idea how the system works. I know this edit will come off as sensitive and I'm not trying to come off as if I'm genuinely upset, because at the end of the day it's the internet it's not that deep, but please be mindful that not everyone has had the same resources you've had, and that includes education, knowledge and support. 💕

Embarrassing reason why I cannot get a service dog,"My health is declining, I have a part-time caretaker. But I want to be more independent with daily tasks. I have also a life-threatening disease and I've read there are service dogs that can detect low blood pressure, which would allow me to emergency-inject solu-cortef and the dog have a way to call paramedics if I pass out.

I also have a son. I do get help taking care of him, but not financially. I'm on SSI because of my disabilities. So money is always tight.

I know there are helpful organizations that I could probably work with to get a service dog.

The problem: monthly expenses for the dog, including but not limited to vet, medications, food, toys, shelter, bed, various things like ropes and stuff to help me perform tasks. 

I just can't afford it. I'm really bummed. 

This illness is going to be the death of me.

And I've looked into smart watches for blood pressure - apparently none of them are very accurate. Not to mention my declining physical state.

I am venting, I'm sorry, I just wish I could have one.

(I have experience with extensive training of a couple dogs in my pre-disabled years)

Edit: Why did I get downvoted? I am just being honest, I'd love to be less likely to die fron my disease thanks to a service dog. It's not like I'm being a jerk or something.

My parents (65 & 70) and I can no longer fund my sister's (29f) nursing home care. ,"My (30 female) sister (29 female), “Sarah”, was born with Prader Willi syndrome (PWS). PWS is a rare genetic issue that results in a variety of cognitive and physical disabilities . For example, Sarah struggles with mobility and fine motor skills. While she can walk and talk, she met these milestones much later on than other toddlers. She also faces challenges with intaking and processing new information and skills. She struggles with behavioral issues as well. Most individuals with PWS require such intensive medical and behavioral support, they live in residential facilities in adulthood. The medical and physical issues that come along with PWS are so severe, many of those with PWS do not make it into their 40s. 

Because of the severity of my sister‘s disability, she has been collecting Social Security, as well as being on government health insurance (Medicaid) since she was a young adult. When she turned 18 my parents obtained legal guardianship over her because she will need constant care. Having a child with special needs is extremely expensive. Over the decades, my parents always managed to make ends meet. Now that they are in retirement, they are on a severely limited income themselves. Luckily, I make decent money so I have been able to help them out financially especially as I entered my mid 20s and established myself in my career more. 

In 2021 Sarah got incredibly sick. She developed a respiratory issue where her lungs were producing too much CO2 and not enough oxygen. She almost died. At the hospital, the doctors gave her a trach and put her on a ventilator. Her condition slowly improved over time. She still has a trach, and only uses the ventilator at night. The doctors were very clear with us that it would take a while to transition her completely off the vent, and we could be looking at a timeline of a year or longer before she was ready to come back home. 

After Sarah had been at the nursing home for about six months. my dad mentioned that her state insurance was no longer covering the full cost of the nursing home and they were getting billed for a couple hundred dollars a month. I offered to help them with these, which my dad accepted periodically. But, they weren’t telling me the full story on how quick these bills were piling up. Earlier this week, my dad called me very stressed out. Apparently there’s an outstanding bill from the nursing home for $15,000. Apparently the the bill has been steadily rising and my dad was hesitant to ask me because I’ve already helped them quite a lot this year. I make a good salary but I cannot cover $15,000. Even covering half of it would be a serious hit to my savings. 

My dad was particularly upset because the nursing home’s billing department had gone into my sister‘s room, asking her about the outstanding bill. Sarah has the cognitive functioning comparable to that of an 8 year old. My sister barely understands the concept of bills. Sarah had a meltdown. My dad was thinking of taking out a loan on their house to pay for this. I told him to pause. Instead, I have connected him with some organizations and nonprofits who offer a combination of financial aid as well as legal/advocacy services for caretakers of those with severe disabilities. I have also connected him to their local state rep and state Senator, who can hopefully provide some insight into additional state resources.

He is following up on those contacts, but I thought that I would come here as well. There’s the immediate question on how to handle the current $15k outstanding medical bill. I was wondering if anyone else on this thread has experienced similar issues with funding residential care for adults with special needs and are familiar with any resources you could point us to… grant programs, financial aid, etc.

This experience also illuminates some bigger- picture questions about how to finance my sister’s complex medical needs long term. I was speaking with a colleague who also has a sister with severe special needs. She was shocked that we were still trying to pay these costs out of pocket. She explained that, when her parents died, the rest of her siblings explored their legal options and found out that if their sister was made a ward of the state, she was eligible for the state to provide better medical care (as opposed to her siblings having to fund it out of pocket). However that varies state by state. We live in Illinois.

My parents and I are now wondering if we should re-asses my dad having legal guardianship over my sister. I don’t know how much longer we can continue to keep up with her costs. I don’t think I can fund nursing home care for her as well as support children of my own once my parents are gone. 

So, the second part of my question is if anyone here has knowledge about guardianship status of adults with special needs and how that intersects with the state vs. the parents having the responsbility to pay such costs.

I will also be posting this on a couple of legal subreddits. I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this.",84,1ejxtqy,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ejxtqy/my_parents_65_70_and_i_can_no_longer_fund_my/,25,1722785156.0

The Period From HELL With PCOS: Bleeding For 170 Days & Counting,,0,1ekq1vx,disability,https://youtu.be/QKT0aP3ktQU,0,1722870153.0
Someone told me last night that they're more disabled than me so I should help them,"I don't even know what to do with this, they're literally not disabled they just won't do their physical therapy so  it's becoming a chronic condition.

They never help me and make things difficult for me.  Now they want me to sympathize with them and be their caregiver when they denied and continue to deny me one.

It's like the entire time since the accident they simply don't believe I'm disabled even after watching me go through the absolute torment of over two hours of nerve conduction tests because the doctor tried to make it out like I was faking too so I got tested **extra thoroughly**.  If any of you know how those tests work, they jab two probes like knitting needles into your nerve centers and chase it with the needles down the path of innervation. 

Yes, if your connection to your spinal cord is gone, there is no pain.  It just feels like pushing...

When they are probing to find the edge of the damage, it's, again quite literally, jamming a giant sharp probe down into your body to hit the nerve centers - PAIN.  PAIN is what they use to test if you are really disabled.  

You **WILL** scream.  I passed out a couple times, but you have to be awake and your nervous system fully unimpaired, so you get no numbing, anesthesia, etc...

They brought in another guy to supervise the tester because he thought he was doing it wrong (he wouldn't say but DUH), then they brought in a guy to supervise the guy that was supervising to make sure the equipment was working right.  Because I wasn't screaming when they thought I should be.

They were there for that, yet they still tell me to my face that I'm faking it and I don't need any help, that I am ungrateful for the food I get and the little bit of clean space I can have.

How can someone you love watch you scream for two hours and still dismiss you?

Please tell me it's going to get better.  Please tell me there's an after.  I just want to give up and the pain to stop.  I don't want to stop fighting for my abilities but it seems pointless with all the obstacles constantly presented me...neglect, abuse, ""unintentional"" harm, I'd say I can't take it anymore but I know I have to.

Every day is just making it through all the things they throw on me to try and break me further.

I don't know what to do and there's nothing you can say that will really help.

I need help and there isn't going to be any.  I have to figure this out on my own while still being constantly dragged under by selfish people with no empathy who claim to love me but throw down when there's no ""extra money"" while complaining that everything is on a payment plan and sorry we don't have enough for food for you.  I have to ask when people come home (I can't leave but they can) if they have any leftover food or whatever they don't want.

I got yelled at for trying to clean up my area yesterday afternoon because people that work odd hours and don't give schedule or pay any bills but buy themselves ebikes, cars, and high end PC computers somehow had to suddenly be in bed at 9pm on a saturday night because they have to work at 4am on sunday...wtf.  I can't stand up for myself because it gets me threatened, ignored, or the next week will be MANY random obstacles that just HAPPEN to completely obstruct the walk way and I can't step over nor hardly walk in the first place.  Passive aggressive harm is still harm, just because you did nothing doesn't mean you're innocent.  Yelling ""I never said that"" while I'm trying to explain how I feel like you hate me because of the way you TREAT me, NOT what you SAY.  Your behavior is your words yet everyone else is held to task; what about this and that, never any actual discourse leading to solutions - only invalidation and control.

I guess it is just a rant, after all.  If anyone has actually read this or cares, I will feel a bit better.  Solves nothing, but feeling a little better is better than feeling a little less better I suppose.",43,1ek2b21,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ek2b21/someone_told_me_last_night_that_theyre_more/,17,1722796497.0

Requesting work accomodations? Am I disabled enough?,"Currently I work as a contractor for my current company. Though they have a strict hybrid policy, I don't have to abide by it because I'm contracted. I have numerous minor conditions that make working in person difficult. Pre-covid, Id have to take off 2-3 days each month because of it, but otherwise worked in-person (though it sucked.)

I have a fragrance allergy that makes it difficult to focus, strong fragrances give me asthma attacks but that I can avoid by moving spaces unless there's a PARTICULAR person causing problems. I've had IBS my whole life, can bring a heating pad in for that.

In the last few years I have cyclic vomiting syndrome though which can put me completely out of commission for a week. I just sit on my bathroom floor with my laptop on my lap. Maybe once every 2 months.

Please help me,"I don't know what do to, I'm just so lost. I (21f) was diagnosed with fibromyalgia earlier this year. My mother has the same and was abusive while I had to ignore it and care for her anyway, and now I'm seeing so much of it in myself. I snap and get irritable when I'm in pain or tired, I've had to apply for PIP for the first time and it's ruined me mentally. I was made redundant recently from my desk job which was still hard to manage but was the best I was going to get, and now I'm struggling to find anything I can handle while my boyfriend and his family are trying to be supportive but still putting pressure on me every day to find something to keep money coming in.

My whole family always called my mother lazy, self-absorbed and manipulative. She was all of those things don't get me wrong, but it was Her not her disability. They all blamed the fibromyalgia and now I feel like they won't take me seriously either even when I'm in both physical and mental agony. I've been screaming for help, from anyone, but it's like I don't exist.

The guilt of just existing with this condition is eating me alive. I pull muscles and trap nerves so often my boyfriend has learned how to wash my hair for me since I often can't move enough to do it myself. I know he doesn't mind, but I minded doing it for my mother and never said otherwise. I can't stand thinking I'm making him feel the way I felt. I've also decided to never have children because 1. my body cant handle it anyway and 2. i refuse to traumatise them with my own pain.

I'm 21. I should be out enjoying the summer sun, doing brunch with my friends, going swimming at the beach. Instead I haven't left my house in a week and am constantly 🍃 just to cope.

I've referred myself back to therapy for both the condition and some recent events that haven't helped. I just want to be seen. I want people to tell me they understand and that I'm not going crazy. I know logically I never asked to be made this way, but damn my life was never meant to be this way. I was never meant to give up dance despite it being my first love and my first identity since I was 4. I was never meant to consider a wheelchair just to go shopping.

I've never lost someone (when I was old enough to understand, anyway) but I imagine what I'm feeling is grief. I'm literally grieving the life I am currently living. 

Sorry this was so long, I hate talking about it but I just needed to feel less alone today.

Disabled son needs medication for his chronic illness but he refuses to go to the doctor and telehealth won’t treat his condition. Looking for ideas.,My son (20) is severely autistic. Unfortunately due to his physiology he also suffers from chronic inner ear infections. He gets them at least once every month or two and the only thing that cures them is a full course of antibiotics. The problem I’m having is that when he’s in pain he expresses it by acting out behaviorally. He absolutely refuses to go to the doctor. I’ve tried doing telehealth which would be great but ear infections is one thing they have to be seen in person for. So I’m at a complete loss here. He needs antibiotics to get better but refuses to go see the doctor to get them and that’s the only way to get them. It’s a catch-22.

"Severe flair from getting a tattoo (eds, pots, nerve pain + unspecified autoimmune disorder) anyone relate? ","So I got a tattoo today (we finished about 12 hours ago now) and I'm definitely in the beginning of a huge flare up. I have quite a few so it's not like this was my first one and now I'm having this reaction, but it was one of my biggest ones yet (about 5x3.5 inches I only have one bigger than this one). I'm having really bad nerve pain in the arm I got the tattoo on and in both legs and its a lot worse than my baseline, my HR was around 140 the entire time I was getting tattooed and it stayed there for a while but it's finally dropped to around 110 laying down. My artist was great! Shes a registered cna caregiver outside of being a tattoo artist and she works with people with pots often so she knew to check in a lot and was really fine with breaks when I needed them which definitely helped the few times my heart rate really got up there, but just getting the tattoo was triggering my pots and I'm finally starting to come down from that

But mostly what I'm worried about is the autoimmune reaction I'm having, I always have an autoimmune reaction to new piercings and tattoos, usually a low fever for a few days and a lot of swelling and itching (especially at the body mod site and the surrounding joints, but also all my healed tattoos swell up and itch) but this one is feeling particularly bad, my fever is higher than usual, the onset was faster, the swelling is worse (I can barely bend my arm and have a lot of swollen lymph nodes) I almost feel like I have the flu and I feel too fatigued to do pretty much anything, I'm worried that I'm especially allergic to the brand of ink that was used or something 

Way too much of being disabled feels like try to find the line between ""worthy of an ER visit"" and ""it'll probably go away on its own"" 😭 

Anyways not really asking for advice (but I wouldn't say no to some if anyone has it) but mostly I just wanted to see if anyone else has bad reactions or flares when they get body mods?

Do the symptoms ever stop for more than a couple hours?,"I have schizoaffective disorder depressive type and PTSD. A few other things too. I've been on medication for years. I may be a little less paranoid now but I still have panic attacks, major depression, thoughts of self harm, and acts of self harm. I think about offing myself in various different ways throughout the week. Mostly just with a gun. I'm on gabapentin, risperidone, and fluoxetine. I have another one as well but I have only used it twice. None of these meds stop the reoccurring thoughts. I can't imagine something strong enough to stop the panic attacks. I'm ashamed of myself for not having emotional control, likely because I was raised in a sexist household where men didn't cry. I barely have motivation to do much more than read online. We have suffered financially, socially, and with family since before I was diagnosed. We still have left over problems in my family for the issues that may have arisen from my schizophrenia. I still think my freinds and family were making bets against me and profiting off my failures and successes at work. Does this ever go away or will I feel jilted forever. I hate this feeling. I want to go back to equality between me and my siblings. I want to feel welcomed among freinds again instead of worrying what they have heard about me.

Job Interview Advice,"So, for reference walking into this post. I'm 22M, recent college grad, have an invisible disability (however invisible you consider high-functioning autism to be), and have recently begun looking for work.

For me, I decided to start leaning towards retail stores for my choice of where to begin my job hunt. This is largely because my disability is paired with a peanut allergy, so I can't really do places that force me to interact with peanuts/peanut products. I've gotten a few interviews so far, but no dice. 

I've come to the conclusion that it may be an hours thing, as retail stores usually desire evening/weekend availability. However, part of the problem I have here is that my disability renders evenings/weekends unavailable as these times are how I keep my stress/mental health in check and ensure that I am living a healthy life. Because of the need for structure, switching things up constantly or working unorthodox hours is a no-go. 

So, I'm trying to come up with a proper way to address this on future job applications and interviews moving forward to hopefully bolster my odds, and I figured this was a good place to start for advice. My understanding of ADA is that if I am rejected for the sole reason of my disability (ie, my disability renders evenings/weekends unavailable but they desire me to work those hours), that would be disability discrimination, which of course, is illegal. Lying about my availability is sketchy, taboo, and possibly even illegal. Mentioning a disability in an interview can sometimes open up discrimination that way, which is bad. How would I go about my disability in a way that ensures I can't be rejected based on the accommodation I would need, without striding any moral or legal lines?",4,1ek3r23,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ek3r23/job_interview_advice/,6,1722800058.0

Should I just give up on disability until I'm older? ,"So I (20f) have Autism and Adhd, citrullinemia type II (which is a rare protein condition, and may affect me more now that I'm an adult but I don't know how much it will effect me) And possibly something else,, I have two doctor appointments, one to go over blood work to see if I have arthritis for the pain I have, and the other for my condition so they can do more research on it. I have already applied for disability I believe in April/may? and we are waiting for the results but I'm sure I'll get denied since it's my first time. 

the thing is i honestly don't know if I should apply again after it. But i don't know if I can really keep a job and not end up wanting to quit in 4 months. The last two jobs I have had around month 4 I would cry before going in because of the constant 9/10 pain, and how horrible I felt. I kept saying to myself that it was normal to feel like this. I also was stubborn and still went to work at my last job because I didn't want to quit but I had to resign because I was throwing up for a month straight almost and missed a lot of work. Turned out to be a uti, even though they didn't detect it in the first two hospital visits, but I got medicine for it and it seemed to help. Being off of work has helped as well with pain. 

I kept silent about the pain until now since this last month I have had terrible back and feet pain and broke down. I still feel like my pain isn't valid at all even when I'm in pain, or not in pain. I haven't worked in a year but doing things around the house can even exhausted me fast especially if its hot.

I have told my family about my autisim and adhd but it's been dismissed (maybe I didnt explain it correctly, but I still get dismissed for voicing things that effect me) and they think I can still do everything and my issue is that I'm just lazy. and just because they can work I can(even my cousin with adhd say I'm just lazy and it hurt me a little ngl) . My grandma has already voiced since I'm 20 I can't possibly understand pain or having trouble getting up when waking up, but I do.

My friends mom doesn't know everything since I only talked for a couple minutes about it but she said that disability won't care because I'm young and have some pain. which I completely have already thought about but having other people say it just makes me more hopeless about it.

my mom and therapist are the only ones that truly has shown support and think I need at least to get medical diagnosis. It's helped that they support me but I haven't been able to 100℅ accept it myself. especially with feeling like an imposter. I feel like now I'm just a big baby and nothing (including audhd) is real anymore and I'm actually just lazy. I'm just stuck.

Doing YouTube as a wheelchair user,"
Hi everyone👋 My names Bell, I’m 23 and a full time wheelchair user from the UK!🇬🇧 

I’ve recently started a YouTube channel called Blue_Bellife in the hopes of making new friends that I can connect with as loneliness and low self esteem is something that I’ve struggled with. Never in a million years did I think I’d be doing something like this and every time I post a video I have to fight so hard not to delete it but so far it’s been okay🙂I’m a bit of a homebody and I enjoy making videos about things that bring me joy whether that’s taking my dogs for a walk, stuffing my face with my favourite food😅or working on some of my hobbies. My goal is to make honest, realistic videos about the highs and lows of everyday life as a wheelchair user to hopefully share a little happiness to others, make some new online friends and help people feel less alone despite what you’re going through in life!

Is there any other disabled YouTubers here? Has your experience been positive? I’m scared about hate comments, I haven’t received any yet but I’m sure it will come eventually😕

Social Security is the Worst,"Long story short, after my reevaluation I lost my SSI benefits. The reason, I kept student loan refund, and they see it as income, even though it’s not my money.

I dropped the part-time enrollment because there’s only one more course for my degree, I was aware of this a year ago, so I kept it.

They looked in my bank account, saw it, and I explained that it wasn’t income, it was a loan. I explained that I kept it anticipating tuition, books, and supplies would run me about $2500-$3000. 

I have since paid tuition, and have the books and supplies budgeted for, I’m well under $2000, the rest of the money went back to the loan, and now I have just $267.

The asset limit is a load of garbage, it needs increased. Considering it was not income, it’s even more irritating. It feels like we are punished for trying to better ourselves.

Would getting this checked out be worth it? ,"Due to lifelong symptoms and both confirmed and remembered events it’s suspected I had a brain injury or serious head injury that went undiagnosed and untreated when I was between the ages of 0 and 9. Possibly made worse by one or more of my untreated concussions throughout my childhood. No one ever believed me about my memory problems, emotional regulation problems or any of my other symptoms so I never got proper help… now as an adult with a few professionals who actually listen to me the bigger picture is coming together. But it’s way too late for any treatment so I’m not sure if the effort is worth it. 

Quick background: born via vacuum after they lost my heart rate. I was so tiny i couldn’t breast feed.

My head has been hit hard many times throughout my childhood. Mostly accidents…

I’ve shown symptoms of autism from a very young age but as a teen I started noticing a level of self awareness that honestly, makes me feel like I’m trapped. Like my brain is inside a typical brain and I know it’s there but I can’t access it.

Also my memory is very unpredictable and unorganized. Like a filing cabinet that keeps getting thrashed, reorganized, burned and recycled. 

My brain has always struggled with positive emotions and memories. My baseline seems to be depression and I don’t know why. That didn’t show up until late elementary school as far as I’m aware. Sadly it’s hard for me to know my own emotions. Especially positive ones. I’ve learned how to recognize negative emotions well because it’s what I have most of the time. 

I have auditory hallucinations that are mostly sounds and gibberish voices. Under stress they get worse and eventually if stressed enough I have visual hallucinations. 

I have a hard time describing how I feel and what I’m experiencing making help far from possible most of the time. What I’m describing doesn’t even come close to the full extent of this… 

I’ve had psychosis before and sometimes I still have vivid hallucination states where I’m in a strange place or someone else. Usually I snap out of it slowly and they don’t last more than a few minutes. It takes me a moment to collect myself because of the confusion from coming back to reality. There’s one I have repeatedly. 

Sometimes I feel like I’m somebody else within myself. Sometimes that makes me worry that the imaginary voice I created as a kid is a part of him… that voice developed into its own entity as I got older. 

These symptoms and more really screw with my head and stress me out. I feel like I need to claw open my skull and rip my brain out! It’s overwhelming, frustrating, scary and another emotion I can’t explain. Usually it’s just normal to me but when I start realizing it’s a prison cell again it’s really gets to me ",1,1ek1ofn,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ek1ofn/would_getting_this_checked_out_be_worth_it/,1,1722794912.0
Device/way to alert partner who doesn't hear me calling her name?,"My partner just straight up does not hear me call her name and we recently moved to a place that has even thicker walls than our last apartment. She frequently leaves her phone in the room where I am during the times I most need her help. There have also been times where she's had her phone and just straight up has not felt/noticed me calling her on it. I don't want to use a little bell because that feels rude and demeaning.

Is there some sort of wearable device that exists where I could ping her on it if she's in another room that won't also call 911? Cause that's what the fall devices do and I don't need that. This is for when I'm symptomatic and cannot sit up and either cannot or do not want to scream at the top of my lungs in order to get her help.

I know the ""Bond touch bracelets"" are an option and would allow me to use my apple watch to buzz her, but I really would prefer to have something that has a distinct noise or ringtone. She's a composer, so I know she'd be likely to notice a specific chime.

I was originally injured in 2005 in a car accident that has caused so many issues over the years that it's been really hard to hold down a job. I would miss so many days because I was unable to get out of bed for days due to pain and spasms. Because of this my job history looks terrible. I'm worried they are going to claim that if I never really held down a job in the decade, why would I need disability. The answer to that has a lot to do with inflation honestly. It has become increasingly difficult to live with a 1 income household. And I've tried to work, I really have. But for the last 2 years I havent even been  able to babysit or clean on the side like I could before when things were especially hard financially. And now things are much worse. My initial injury set into motion everything that led to the explosion of surgeries in the last 2 years, including 9 surgeries. I do have a glimmer of hope since the lawyer took my case. But it doesn't mean I will be approved. I'm here looking for advice. What kind of paperwork will help my case? I don't want to overload them, but I dont want to leave anything important out either. And please don't suggest any type of fraud! I am not here looking for anything like that at all! I don't need to lie, I have enough trouble as it is just getting to the bathroom to worry about committing perjury. I can provide whatever other kind of information you need that might help give a better answer. 

The 5 year rule has MANY exceptions. Catastrophic conditions are under one of those conditions, and spinal cord injuries are one of them. The issue started many years ago and I've applied for disability before and was denied because I didn't know that lawyers were free unless you won. I had only just turned 18 when it started. That accident led to what I am dealing with now because my spine collapsed due to the initial injury. I'm not sure if I'm really explaining it well. But you can look up cauda equina syndrome, and exceptions to the 5 year rule. I'm not doing this because I want a hand out. I'm doing this because I have tried and failed to work for years because of this. And now there is no possibility of even working for a month here and there to make ends meet.

Newly disabled ,"On May 30th I (39 M) was run over by a semi trailer.  My brachial plexus was damaged. I don't fully know the extent, but as a result I've lost the ability to use my right arm. It will be 6 months to a year before I know if it'll heal.

I, however, believe in planning for the worst. So what I'm curious about is, what are some helpful tips for reconciling myself with the loss of use of my arm. I have worked manual jobs my entire life, I have no college education. I feel lost with my future if I never get my arm back. 

I was ambidextrous, I use my left hand to write and eat, but most other tasks were right side dominant.

I'm still healing so mobility is difficult now, but once I'm able to move better, what can I expect in terms of adjusting to life with a paralyzed arm?",35,1ej4zrz,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ej4zrz/newly_disabled/,15,1722696240.0
Doing YouTube as a wheelchair user,"
Hi everyone👋 My names Bell, I’m 23 and a full time wheelchair user from the UK!🇬🇧 

I’ve recently started a YouTube channel called Blue_Bellife in the hopes of making new friends that I can connect with as loneliness and low self esteem is something that I’ve struggled with. Never in a million years did I think I’d be doing something like this and every time I post a video I have to fight so hard not to delete it but so far it’s been okay🙂I’m a bit of a homebody and I enjoy making videos about things that bring me joy whether that’s taking my dogs for a walk, stuffing my face with my favourite food😅or working on some of my hobbies. My goal is to make honest, realistic videos about the highs and lows of everyday life as a wheelchair user to hopefully share a little happiness to others, make some new online friends and help people feel less alone despite what you’re going through in life!

Is there any other disabled YouTubers here? Has your experience been positive? I’m scared about hate comments, I haven’t received any yet but I’m sure it will come eventually😕

I’ve included a few pictures of me and my two Pomeranians 🐻‍❄️Buddy & Bee🐻who keep me going even when I don’t think I can.

Help dealing with work?,"A little about me: I’m autistic and have ADHD as well as a couple milder chronic physical issues that don’t have diagnoses yet. Long story short I was very severely affected by mental illness for a long time and I have fought tooth and nail as I grew up to be able to not be jobless, homeless, or dead by now. Over the years I have accrued a lot of work trauma from employers who simply do not like me/do not want to deal with me and have found bullshit reasons to fire me without offering any assistance or alternatives.

Now, my situation: I am on my second round of corrective action up to a final warning at my career level job that I’ve worked at for over 2 years now. I do not sit and refuse to do work and most issues that have been raised by any employer including this one have been directly disability-related (communication, interpersonal interaction, etc). I am well versed in what I need to succeed as I have had IEPs since elementary school and have had to fight to have those enforced too, and I have offered multiple suggestions during and before my recent performance improvement plan. Well, they were all ignored and I was looked at like I had three heads suggesting them, even though one suggestion (a moderated meeting with the coworkers taking issue with me, of whom there are not a ton) has already been implemented once with a previous coworker and was largely successful. They deemed the PIP a failure and gave me the final warning. This is not new behavior from management - this workplace has a history of just taking me in for a meeting with no agenda sent beforehand (also something I’ve repeatedly asked for) and telling me all the things I did wrong, with little productive discussion on solving these things. Every time I try to reiterate that I have asked for things I am not getting and that their communication to me is also lacking, they just tell me to take accountability, despite me stressing myself into physical health issues trying to meet their requests. I am not refusing to put effort in, and in fact I am trying every avenue I can to help myself. I have cried in these meetings because of the things said to me. I have been made to feel broken and terrified about anything I do there, and as an autistic person I do not work well under that constant anxiety, so this is also actively sabotaging my performance while I am already under corrective action for said performance.

I am in the process of disputing the final warning so that I can try and move to a different department under different management, but even then I would still need to actually get hired and hope they aren’t massively ableist there too, which is complicated by the fact that I already asked to try and transfer out of this environment while still on corrective action and was refused before the appeal decision on the final warning was even made. If they don’t annul the final warning based on my dispute, per policy I am stuck in this job for a year, with ableist management that could cost me my livelihood at any moment. 

There are only two other facilities in the area like the one I work at, and both are a 45+ minute commute and offer less benefits and a more customer-facing workload that I would struggle with. I am currently surviving and *sometimes* able to scrape together enough to be saving for a home in a high COL area because of the benefits I have that make my and my chronically ill partner’s healthcare nearly free, and because of the fact that I only have to fill up on gas around once a month due to my short commute. So I cannot get fired or leave this facility, or I would be poorer than I already am and potentially struggle even more with the new work. Moving back with my parents last time I did it in college almost killed me, so I am trying to avoid that as well.

I don’t know what to do. The decision on the final warning is coming on or before Wednesday, and if they uphold it and I do nothing then I’ll probably lose my job within the year. It feels like there is no getting through to these people that I need different help than a lot of others, or they’re just not interested in giving it. Hopefully now that I have spoken to my supervisor’s boss (most of the issues are with my supervisor and he’s a micromanager of course) something will get done, but she’s going to be the one making the decision so if she doesn’t overturn it I know she’s not in my corner either.",1,1ejpxok,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ejpxok/help_dealing_with_work/,2,1722757925.0

I use Google Keep Notes, Gmail, and Docs.

Was I wrong for using the handicap stall?,"To be clear, I am NOT disabled. I used to work as a server at a restaurant and while getting drinks for on of my tables, I spilled boiling hot water all over myself. I ended up scaulding my stomach pretty badly, to the point where I had blisters. 

I retrieved some medical supplies from a first aid kit and went to the restroom to dress my burn. There was only one bathroom in the restaurant that was shared by the customers and staff. I went into the disability stall since the burn covered a farly large area on my body and I'd have more space to take my clothes off and work with the bandages and such. 

As I'm dressing the wound, an older lady with a walker comes into the bathroom and starts scolding me through the door, and telling me that I should pick a different stall to get changed. I told her I was almost finished, and she responded with something like ""I only have one stall to use, you could have chosen any other. I can't wait all day if every normal person needs to use my stall."" 

Rather than telling her my situation I just tried to finish and clean up the wrappers as quickly as possible. I figured I didn't want to start a potential argument since I was still in uniform representing the business. On my way out I apologized to her and went home for the day.

This happened a while ago and I recently came across a video talking about invisible reasons someone may need to use the handicap stall. I understand it must be frusterating having someone without a disability use the stall, and I do gernally try to avoid it. So since I am not disabled, it made me curious: was I in the wrong?

FSHD (Fascio Scapular Humeral Muscular Dystrophy) and sports ,"FSHD and sports

30m here with confirmed FSHD. Is there any of you, or anyone you know with the disease that participate in sports at a high level? I myself have been suffering since my early teens however was not diagnosed until I was 27. In the meantime, although I knew something was very wrong with me and progressing, I took up an extreme form of mountain biking (freeride and downhill). I got to a level where I was competing in the professional level categories and started riding alongside some of the best athletes the sport has globally, not that I was ever quite at their level but enough that I was on their heels. I’ve never divulged my disability but in the past couple of years it has progressed to the point where the disease is beating out my ability to push my limits and I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with the same kind of situation. I’m scared to go fully public with it but I’m considering reinventing my now defunct career as a non-able bodied athlete instead, although that overwhelmingly feels like cheating or that I won’t be taken seriously due to me riding at the level I have done without a visible disability. Or, even more of a long shot, does anyone know of a manager willing to work with disabled action sports athletes? I’m struggling to find anything along those lines myself.

That seems dramatic… but it has crossed my mind before because I don’t leave the house much. It is hard to push myself to do big outings so my only outings are when my dad will take me to doctors appointments or, getting a fun drink at Starbucks. 

Anyway. I’m feeling bad and kinda brain foggy from that. Thanks for reading my rant ",12,1eiqc55,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eiqc55/vacations_while_disabled/,6,1722646410.0
my disability doesnt seem to exist,"first, im not asking for a diagnosis or anything like that, just advice. i think I've got some kind of disorder, at first i thought it was some kind of dysautonomia but the research I've done doesn't suggest any type. pots is the closest thing I've found but with that it affects when u stand up immediately, whereas with me its more if i stand up for a longer period of time. I've talked to my gp, he tested my blood pressure which was normal.

How to stop non medical people stating I'm severely mentally incapacitated,"Hello

  
I have a physical genetic disorder, this causes me flare ups of mobility issues, ie I can be physically capable of anything and everything for months but will then have a flare up and be bedridden for months.

  
It means I don't qualify for disability assistance, though as I'm getting older, my active periods are getting less and my inactive periods increasing so that may change re disability support.

  
My question at the moment is:-

  
I am having to deal with a financial issue, I should have received benefits to cover a time off ill re council tax (this has gone to bailiffs and I am paying off a set amount) but every time I speak to the council and subsequently now the bailiff company, they keep referring to me as severely mentally incapacitated, and they keep requesting I send this documentation through to them for them to be able to assist me.

  
I am not mentally incapacitated, they are not medical people, I am banging my head off a brick wall trying to sort this out with them.

  
Instead of them applying unemployment to the council tax account, they have charged me the full amount. I should have had this covered by unemployment. it hasnt been. They are citing the mental incapacity not being evidenced.

  
I have no clue what to do with people who think I'm not competent, but are quite happy to over charge me.

I am not on a high income, though I keep getting over charged by grubby money grabbers in positions of authority who make this mental incapacity claim without evidence then all avenues of communication are shut down until I provide evidence!!!!

I have evidence of a physical issue, this physical issue is causing intense pain and I often struggle to be coherent, but because of a pain issue, not a mental issue.

  
How do I tell ignorant people they are wrong and need to provide the actual support that is available re unemployment not mental incapacity!

  
For a start, if I was mentally incapacitated I wouldn't be having coherent conversations with them, they'd be dealing with my carer!!!",51,1eia4iu,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eia4iu/how_to_stop_non_medical_people_stating_im/,21,1722605463.0
Advice on socializing as a disabled person?,"I'm about to graduate college and I have a few friends there, but I struggle keeping in touch with them. I find it easiest to socialize with people via proximity (working on a theatre production with them, seeing them around campus, etc.) but seeing people has become more and more difficult. 

My corn allergy makes it so none of the cafeteria food is safe- no meals with anyone, and the progression of my hip dysplasia makes walking anywhere on campus incredibly painful (it also doesn't help my campus was build on the side of mountains.)

This leads to me holing myself up in my dorm except for classes. I don't tend to walk where posters for on-campus events are advertised, so I never know about them, and if I did, I'd probably decide it's not worth the pain to go to them.

I have such a hard time keeping in touch with people I'm not super duper close to, even in an online capacity. I get anxious messaging people I'm super familiar with because I can't see their non-verbal cues.

If it's this hard to keep in touch with people at college where everyone is within a concentrated radius of one another, I can't imagine how hard it will be once I move back home to make new friends. All my friends from childhood were much closer with each other than they were with me, and all of them have moved away. I don't know how I would try to build/keep up a relationship with them anymore, they all have irl friends so they don't spend a ton of time online.

I also live in a fairly small town that most people move away from when they're in their mid-20s, but I can't drive or financially support myself enough to move away, plus I need support from my family with my disabilities. I'm hoping that making friends will be easier once I'm out of college, there's a dnd place in my town that's mostly just hosting space for existing games, but they have other events there too that I might try to go to if I can find the energy, and the community theatre is where I can see myself spending most of my time, so I could potentially meet people through there? 

Idk, I guess I just needed to vent, but any advice on how to socialize/keep up relationships without being able to physically go see people is appreciated.

Disability representation in crochet for mental illness etc,"I follow some artists that have found ways to incorporate representation for physical disabilities e.g stuffed animal with medical aids/bandages. I've only seen one person have represtation for all kinds, she makes cute animal characters (but there's not necessarily 'direct' links?). Then theres artists who design clothing with disabled people in mind etc. 

I really want to try to create some kind of representation with crochet... I have adhd and depression so if anything it'd be for mental illness stuff but ideally for anyone too. Thing is I don't draw so can't make characters per say(don't wanna copy existing artists either) . I also only make animals or decorative things , not clothing. I can also cross stitch. 

But I just genuinely have no idea what might make others feel represented, especially when it comes to mental health stuff. I guess the closest Ive gotten so far is using my university club to try and make events for other students a bit more accessible in terms of activity options, but I want my own art to have something as well. 

Is there anything that anyone here has wished to see incorporated into crochet?? (or fibre arts/handmade items in general) literally any ideas would be helpful as inspiration :))

Adverse side effects?,"I just started a new medication 3 days ago. Today, while at work, I had a new kind of episode. I started feeling nausea, but just ignored it because I feel that a lot. Then my chest started feeling weird. After a few minutes I started having trouble breathing and almost collapsed right there. While trying to catch my breath, a numbing tingling feeling spread throughout my body. My vertigo was triggered and it was a lot all at once. I thought it was heart palpitations at first, but I'm not quite sure. I went home, and the symptoms started lessening after the initial 45 min. It took 3 hours before most of it went away, leaving me with a headache and continued chest weirdness. It's been 11 hours since the episode and I never went to the hospital. I'm not gonna take that medication anymore, but I'm wondering if I should talk to a doctor about seeing a cardiologist? Or get a medical allergy check done?

Why are people needlessly cruel to those of us with invisible disabilities? ,"I don't have a visible physical disability such as missing limbs, but I still have disabilities. People use the anonymity of the internet to bully because it apparently gets them off on making others upset?

Adhd, bipolar, ptsd, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, autism and the countless other mental disabilities that exist. They ARE disabling! 

Those of us with these conditions suffer. If we show our symptoms, people call us crazy or we arent trying hard enough to overcome it/control it, or we just want attention or for people to feel sorry for us. 

If we don't show our symptoms then we don't actually have anything wrong with us and we just want attention and want pity....? See how that works...

""You're just a bunch of snowflakes, everyone has these problems, you're not trying to power through it, you're just crying about it, you just want people to feel sorry for you, you're making it up, you just want to label everything, these didnt even exist when i was growing up, etc etc.""

 These are the comments I see everywhere on social media... and yes it gets to me. Because it's everywhere...

And those of us who are chronic pain patients? Same thing. It's invisible, so we are making it up. "" If it was really hurting that bad, you'd be crying!""

And if I do cry? ""Suck it up, I had to go to work with 2 broke feet. It's not that bad, just take some tylenol.""

So if I'm not crying, it isn't real, if I am crying, I'm being a baby 🫠🫠🫠🫠

How to decide cane vs walker vs rollinator?,"I have no balance left so I use a cane. I can't stand for more than a few minutes.

I don't know why, but I just can't get onboard for the walker and wheelchair ideas. I don't know why I have such issues with them - they would definitely improve my life and enjoyment of the activities I was doing on those few times I leave the house.

trouble using my cane,"For my entire life I’ve struggled to walk long distances. I could always physically do it, but at a certain point I would start to feel “droopy” kind of like i’m melting. For the past few years I’ve been having (diagnosis in slow progress due to anxiety disorder) issues with heartrate and chest tightness, along with knee cracking and what I call “knee fullness” feeling. Need to clarify that I am NOT looking for an armchair diagnosis here, this is just how it is.

Sometime last year I bought a cane to use while walking around my daily life… except I only used it like twice!! I feel like once I start using it, that’s it, and I can’t go back if I ever start to feel more comfortable without it so I just haven’t touched it. I am already trans and am scared to be looked at negatively.

I worry that I don’t actually need it because I won’t be putting much weight onto it, it would serve as a sort of “mobile countertop” that’s with me all the time. I do not faint and am not at any risk of falling without it.

Why Does No One Get It?,"I posted a little while ago about having issues with my landlord about parking. I have a long-term accessible parking placard, and the surface lot of my apartment only has two accessible spots -- but two other tenants with accessible placards, so insufficient accessible parking spots. When I asked about designating an additional parking spot, they turned me down. Ultimately, I chose to ""upgrade"" my parking to the garage because an accessible spot was opening up, and the reasonable accommodation they provided was allowing me to skip the line. I'm now paying $175/mo for parking versus $75 for the surface lot. 

Nearly three weeks ago, a major storm came through and messed up the control panel in my building. No one has been able to access the parking garage since then. They told all of the tenants in the parking garage to park at the church across the street (I'd have to cross a busy freeway exit and climb stairs to get in the building). They \*are\* allowing me to utilize the accessible spots in the surface lot (if they're available). It was supposed to be fixed yesterday, but it is still not working, and there's no clarity on when that will be. To make matters worse, my landlord has said, ""hey, we can't refund you because this was an act of nature and we acted promptly to fix the problem."" I have emailed them directly and explained how this has limited my access (I've mostly been working from home and avoiding going out to not deal with parking). They sent me the same response -- no refund.

This whole situation has caused me tremendous anxiety. I cried on my way home yesterday out of frustration because I genuinely thought it would be fixed. And when I've told family members about how upset I am, their responses are...underwhelming. I texted my mom to give her an update yesterday, and her response was \*literally\* ""that sux."" And then she immediately started texting me in great detail about a pan she got at a garage sale. It's like she didn't even care.

Suggestions for Newly Paralyzed—Please Help!!,"Hello everyone! My previously very active father was recently in a terrible accident leaving him paralyzed. I understand it is very early on in his treatment journey and it is unclear what his permanent disabilities will be at this point. While he continues therapy to hopefully regain some motor skills, I want to find things for him to do that make him feel a sense of independence and normalcy (his pre-accident “normal”) again. He can move his arms up/down, in/out and has some wrist movement, but he currently cannot move his fingers. He is unable to walk or move his legs much beyond some light quad flexing. 

I don’t have anyone in my life with physical disabilities so I’m hoping you all have some suggestions for me for handicap-friendly activities or hacks. I thought about things like a stand/bed clamp for his Kindle and a page turner button so he can read again, but he doesn’t have the dexterity to press the small remote button. We have him set up with audiobooks, but I know it would mean a lot to him if he could read. This is just one example! I’m completely open to other ideas! I just want to surprise him with something that brings him some joy and may help him cope with his new disability. Any suggestions are welcome and we will take all the help, tips, tricks, and ideas we can get! :) 

Edit — He is currently in intensive inpatient rehabilitation (for the next 4-6 weeks). Right now, he is bedridden. He can speak clearly and does not have any cognitive impairment. In that regard, he is exactly as he was pre-accident. Both sides of his body have about the same functionality at this point. Hope this info helps!

My work is discriminating against me because of my mental illnesses,"Long story short I work in sales and I have FMLA time to use as well as reasonable accomodations so for about half a year that allowed me to work 32 hours instead of 40. They said to me that if I kept my sales numbers up I could keep my accomodations and they would reevaluate my accomodations each quarter (which is odd because y'know I just don't STOP being disabled and it's a call center type job so it's a luck of the draw for calls) which I didn't care about at the time because I was a really good seller and calls were good because it was the holidays and people wanted to buy stuff. However during this past month I noticed that they stopped giving me the time of day as the quarter started approaching. They readjusted the type of calls we were getting so that we got more of them and so that the calls were more generalized meaning that I got worse calls and more calls that weren't actually sales calls which in turn hurt my sales numbers. I still pitched the stuff I needed to but my numbers weren't the same and despite me asking for help from my manager I stopped receiving it so I asked for help from my coworkers and friends. 

I was desperately still trying because I cared about keeping my 32 hours a week because it was good for my mental state. Eventually I had so many mental breakdowns that I took a leave of absence for two weeks. Even with the leave I took I was still meeting sales goals this month so it was a shock to me to come back and have a meeting with my manager and another manager where they told me that they wouldn't be granting them to me again because they have ""increased sales need with the holidays coming up"" and that I ""wasn't meeting sales goals for the quarter."" I also found this odd as I have texts between my manager and I from June with him reassuring me that I did great in May and was doing good in June! This statement also meant they weren't accommodating me AT ALL! After dropping this on me knowing I had a vacation planned this month based around my 32 hour schedule my manager told me that if I didn't have PTO to cover the days that are now added into my schedule (ie 5 day work weeks instead of 4) that he wouldn't approve my PTO time he had to manually add in - which is against our companies PTO policy btw. This of course is not recorded because it's on a work computer and I have no recording software downloaded and wouldn't be able to if I tried and they claimed they were going to write this down in our feedback application but I looked today and it's not there!!

Ambulatory Wheelchair User Looking For Advice (with background info),"Hi, so just a heads up, I'm writing on mobile and English is, unfortunately, my native language. Any mistakes are either my own or from the help of autocorrect.

To start, you can call me Blues. I'm 26, my pronouns are they/them, and I've been disabled since I was a baby. Got a lot of issues, but a few of the main ones I've been gifted (/sarcasm) are dysautonomia, orthostatic hypotension, and wonky legs (and that's not even counting my mental health). 

Gotta say, while I enjoy none of my issues, the wonky legs are the biggest thing I struggle to cope with; I can deal with the orthostatic hypotension via sitting in intervals with my legs propped up, but I can't exactly make my home wheelchair friendly for the days I can't even walk without crying or needing my husband to help me. Yeah, I have a cane and a walker/rollator, but... my cane isn't helping as much anymore.

Thus, my husband has pointed out that I may need to try using forearm crutches instead of my cane. The issue I have is summed up pretty easily: Despite the fact I was supposed to get them as a kid, I have no idea how to use them if I got them! Especially with stairs.

So, my biggest questions are narrowed down to these: Would you recommend trying them in place of my cane? If so, how do you use them? ",0,1eihpf9,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eihpf9/ambulatory_wheelchair_user_looking_for_advice/,0,1722623993.0
I feel myself getting more and more tired,"I recently changed doctors for the third or fourth time in the last year. I have moderate to severe back pains and I am finding it harder to walk or do my regular exercise. 

Before this doctor, the suggestions have just been to lose weight. I'm 5'1 and weigh around 190lbs so I don't think it's a ridiculous idea to lose weight, however I've dropped down to 180 in the past and just felt more lethargic and with more pain. I also find it incredibly difficult to lose weight without starving myself and torturing my body with exercise.

My last doctor wanted to put me on metformin to ""lose some weight"" before putting me on weight loss pills. I declined and switched to my current doctor. 

My current doctor sent me for lab work and some xrays and informed me that if the xrays were normal, she would order an mri. I was feeling hopeful since no doctor before even considered an mri.

This morning, she informed me that she is prescribing metformin, a cholesterol medication, with a possibility to go on ozempic later...

At this point, I give up. I'll take whatever fuckass medications they want to pump into me. I may never be able to walk, dance, or run the way I used to ever again.... but at least I'll be a ""reasonable weight"". I give up. If this is some sort of rare disease that is slowly killing me, that's fine. I didn't plan to live this long anyways, I wanted to die at 18. Now I'm struggling to stay afloat at 24 and I can't function like the human being I want to be so why try anymore. 

I'm not looking for pity, I just hope someone can relate to what I'm saying and offer advice or really anything. ",1,1eigde6,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eigde6/i_feel_myself_getting_more_and_more_tired/,2,1722620707.0
how to cope with declining abilities and not being able to things i used to do?,"i’m in my early 20s, i’ve recently gotten a lot sicker and my abilities to do basic tasks and house chores are quickly declining. as someone more recently coming to terms with being disabled and still living at home, i feel so much shame and guilt for how much less i am contributing to the household work than i could before. i am also really sad that can’t show my love in the same ways because i used to push myself to do a lot of acts of service. i know there’s so much creative ways to adapt to this situation but i’m not there yet because right now i just feel horrible. i feel like i should be able to “do my part” as a family member and i keep comparing myself subconsciously to older men in my family who take work and care for granted in an abusive dynamic. i know this is not the case for me, but how do i validate and dignify my disability and pain so that i can constructively process these big changes in my ability and lifestyle? for now,
i keep asking myself, what are all the ways i can pitch in, but there seems to be not much since i’m really suffering. several days, the pain causes me to have very little emotional and mental spaciousness too.

What's my best chance at getting on disability?,"Hi, 21 yr old here. I injured my hip a little over 2 yrs ago at work and it's gotten to a point where I seriously need to stop working. It takes nearly 2 hrs of painful movement everyday just so I can limp into work. I work in a busy restaurant and am walking all day, reaching, carrying stuff, you know a typical restaurant job. I can't do it anymore. When I get off work, I can't sit down because my back is so tightened up from forcing myself to stand upright and the rest of me is on the brink of collapse. I don't leave my home except work because it's so bad. Was trying to give an idea of where I'm at, sorry if it sounds too harsh.

Basically, how do I need to go about this? I hear that oh, you're gonna get rejected because you're working, so you must be fine, type stuff. Well, I'd rather go through this daily trauma than quit and be without money, homeless, no where to sleep, etc, way worse if you know what I mean. For context, I support myself, so if I stopped working, the money stops coming type deal. 

Any advice or anything would be greatly appreciated, I have no idea what I'm doing here, and I'm alone on this tough journey. Thanks everyone 


Edit, I meant to state this originally, I see everyone talking about it now. I don't work at that job anymore, and as it's been 2 yrs, is filing for workers comp a realistic option now? Also, the place I work at now is owned by the same company that owns the business I hurt myself at 2 yrs ago. How is this going to go down?
I originally wanted to get workers comp, but I was living with family at the time, it was a bad situation and the bottom line, they wouldn't let me go that route, and I needed to save money and move away from them.

The loneliness of being disabled in a very ableist country is crushing. TW parental death.,"That's about it, sorry for posting this here but I just don't have anyone I can talk to. 

Yesterday was the anniversary of my mother's death. She died young and tragically (as did others in my life) and I don't have any heirlooms or any of her art, or even photos of her. Her relatives took everything and I was young and poor and couldn't sue as I had no support. But that's another issue entirely. So it makes her death and birthdays even harder as I don't have any pieces of her, so to speak. They didn't even give me her ashes and they didn't even give her a headstone (her relatives were wealthy, she was the artsy bohemian black sheep). 

So anyways all I wanted the last couple days, as cliche as it is (go ahead and laugh) was someone to hold me and comfort me. But I have nobody.

I'm currently trying to severely restrict caloric intake so I can lose weight, hoping (much as I hate that word) that gives me a bit more chance out in this world. Not that I can get out into it here without a car, or a close friend who has one to take me places, as it's just too inaccessible for me any other way in this city. I don't know if being thin again (or at least voluptuous but not extremely fat) and will make these jerks here give me a chance, but, they aren't worth my time anyway. I'm trying to focus on writing and looking better (if only I had the funds for cosmetic surgery, lipo, etc) so I can leave here and find some place I'm appreciated again, as I was before disability and moving to the UK. I have so much to offer but nobody can look past my weight, my wonky face, and my very visible disability.

To others out there without family, with no local friends, who aren't ever considered as romantic partners - I'm sorry you have to endure this too. It's sickening how people, society, and government treat us, and then we're weak or pathetic or not strong and independent enough if we ever talk about it or let it affect us, which ofc it does. 

I've been thru 20 times what those who judge me have, I should be applauded just for still being here and having my wits about me. 

I am not eloquent at all right now (brain injury) and I'm sure there's typos and but I just don't have it in me to edit or condense.  ",128,1ehfj6n,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ehfj6n/the_loneliness_of_being_disabled_in_a_very/,17,1722515629.0

Slippery Cane Handle Solution,If you have issues with your cane handle being slippery I highly recommend going to a farm store and buying horse leg tape. It is essentially the same as the self-sticking ace bandage wrap for a fraction of the cost with a large selection of colors. It took around a minute to get a good tight wrap and only cost me $2.99 + tax for a 5 yard roll. It makes the handle extremely grippy and is a must have with the hot weather in my area.,14,1ehs0rw,disability,https://i.redd.it/o6wmyai2c4gd1.jpeg,2,1722546817.0
What is your internal dialogue like when others (coworkers or family) express disbelief in your disability?,"I'm struggling at my workplace.

At one point, when i was at my worst, i spent a week speaking to my mother about the country we are from just so I could stop questioning  reality, but thats just an example. Recently, its been around my limp and sciatica. 

I speak to and have spoken to multipls therapists and counselors (multiple) about not being belived at work, and about my sense of self. My current therapist thinks it would be a good idea to sort of crowdsource points of view to see how others may deal with this internally, and so: 

What is your internal monologue like when facing this kind of adversity? I know the answer is to just not care. But i dont know how. I do feel confident about myself, but somtimes it just gets to me.

allergies.,"i recently learned i have an allergy to latex/latex adhesive and latex fruit syndrome, and even more recently learned i've become allergic to all peppers (fruit). now, i have to check every ingredients list for them and i'm slowly becoming more n more frustrated at how limited my options are getting. even more-so at how only nut and dairy allergens are highlighted so i have to painstakingly read the entire list, which can get long since i'm American (iykyk), while cross-checking my can't-have list.

ik it sounds like i'm complaining to complain, but i had no idea latex fruit syndrome even existed until i learned the very hard way. my 1st reaction was when i tried avocado toast, took ONE bite and said ""ew, no"", and then had full-body hives and angioedema for three weeks straight. all the while, i had no idea what i was having was a SEVERE allergic reaction because a) no one told me you could be allergic to literally anything/everything and b) it could related to other allergies you have, espec ones that run in the family like mine do. if labels included latex fruit warnings, i probably would've known avocados and pumpkins weren't a random thing i just ~mysteriously~ couldn't have way sooner.

but i digress. this rant started bc i found out my favorite pickle brand uses red bell pepper in their brine and now i have half a jar of pickles i have to just throw away bc i'm the only pickle lover in my family. at least i'm not allergic to cucumber and/or dill like i thought i might've been bc i had eaten sm more pepper than i thought i had last reaction. i've been in/out of the hospital since Tues last week and Thurs (pickle-pepper aftermath) was the worst visit by far.",2,1ehwyrn,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ehwyrn/allergies/,6,1722560023.0

She positioned herself just behind my right shoulder, waited till I lifted my right hand from my walker and took her hand and lifted up and shook my fucking walker nearly making me fall. She says she wanted to know if it was lightweight bc it looked lightweight and she has one at home but it’s too heavy for her.

It doesn't cause much stress and is mostly sedentary. Physically it takes a little out of me but I usually recover by the end of the night. I'm also on SSDI

I'm starting to burn out. Between autism, chronic pain, chronic fatigue, shizoaffective disorder, and a variety of annoying things. My pain and fatigue are the worst.

 I really loved my job. The healthcare system is broken but I was able to make a difference in people's lives and make things better. But for the last 3 months I've been slowly burning out and I'm near the end of my rope, physically and mentally. I don't want to lose my client. we've been working together 3 years. If I leave or take a sabbatical he'll go to someone else and he has a lot of trouble coping with change. Also his family considers me a member of the family. It's a great situation but I'm struggling.

The thing I was thinking about going into reselling. I did it before and I was good at it. It's basically buying items low and selling high. Except for getting the stuff it's all online. The physical part has me concerned. There's packaging, taking pics, organizing, etc. the paperwork for the SSA and the state are convoluted and Kafkaesque. There will be a lot of driving and that makes me tired. Don't get me wrong, I've done it before and can do it again. It will aggravate my pain but not to the point of exhaustion. I can pace myself and take breaks though.

I have to keep working cause bills.

Someone purposely put a large garbage bin in my path.,"I walk at night/early morning with my rollator very often. It's short distances with LONG brakes. 
As I (22 F) was walking down hill (which I find difficult) a guy putting his bins in his entrance (its trash day that same morning) spots me slowly walking down the hill.
Maybe 8 meters away the guy pushes one of many very large and over filled bin right on the sidewalk. As he pushes it he's looking at me. 

Since it was 2 am I don't react at all but I'm hoping he'll get it, so I don't have to get off the sidewalk...
I was so wrong he instead looks at me the whole freaking time as I double check I won't get hit by a car as I drop off the side walk to walk around his disgusting large bin. 

Then after I hop back on the sidewalk not even a minute later he moves it back into his driveway.

Weight gain,"Honestly I could cry. Also hi new here. I have become physically disabled after a pregnancy related injury and it’s just getting worse. Before pregnancy I was essentially a gym rat. 3-5 days a week, HITS, weights you name it. I have PCOS so weight has always been an issue since puberty, but I eat ok and my food intake has never had a huge effect on loss or gain of weight, but level of activity has and medication/ hormone fluctuations. Since becoming less able to move up till now where I pretty much can’t walk without agony, I’ve put on so much weight, which in turn is not helping my back hips. I’ve tried restricted diets, done physiotherapy. Keep piling on the weight and get told to eat less. I’m also Autistic, so I eat quite a bland diet anyway, and done have a big appetite (like 2 slices of toast is more than enough to keep me going for a while and I’m not a big snack eater) I just don’t know what to do. My docs won’t even see me despite putting in appointment requests. They just send me a new pain med prescription and re-referral me to the same people who keep tell me to essentially starve myself and do not believe my food diary is accurate.

How do you deal with discrimination in social situations?,"This is something I really struggled with. I'm visually impaired and have poor balance. So sometimes I walk slower for safety reasons. There was a time I was on a family vacation and some nosey elderlies noticed this and asked why I was walking slower than them. My mom then apologized on my behalf which made me sad that I had to be ashamed of my disability. She was upset how I made her look bad. It was normalized growing up where people told me that I was a burden to my family and I would constantly have to apologize for not being able to see better.

Anyone with MCAS or mastocytic enteritis here? I have some questions ,"I've been dealing with some pretty significant health issues since late 2019/2020, my allergies being one of them. After a lot of research and suffering I chatted with my allergist about MCAS. She thought I had it, gave me some zaditen, and then I forgot to follow up and do the test, my bad. The meds seemed to work well and I figured out my triggers. In 2020 I experienced my first bout of potential anaphylaxis (I turned red, I developed hives, my eyes and lips began swelling, and I felt so horrible and panicky). It's been extraordinarily difficult trying to get doctors to treat me seriously. Anyways, I'm starting to think about pursuing my allergy issues again and seeing an allergist, but before I do I was hoping I could chat with other MCAS as I have some questions.

Being young and disabled is hard!,"I am a 26 year old androgynous human, that has peripheral neuropathy, degenerate hips and lower spine, as well as scoliosis and PTSD. A lot of people don't see my bad days because, like most of us I'm sure, I don't go out really on bad days. 
I have a disability placard and mobility aids; Walker and wheelchair we got from goodwill. 
I feel like I can't go out in public without being either judged or harassed because I don't look like a cripple enough?😭 Like no offense to anyone except ableists but we can't all look like people that had to have their limbs amputated?? 
I've been harassed for using a mobility aid in public, they acted like the wheelchair was theirs because he was older than me. 
Even parking, because apparently the DMV didn't give me the actual wheelchair user placard? I didn't know there was a different one for that, but I was told by someone that I didn't have the right one and that someone could tow our car if I parked in Van accessable without the right pass and it's just so anxiety inducing because just the process alone of getting one is a hassle, let alone going back more than once to get ""the right one"" 😭 I even filled out the paperwork for the wheelchair user one so I assumed I was good??
Everyone just assumes that because they see me walking that I'm just faking it but I'm in so much pain constantly that not even pain meds, muscle relaxers, and cannabis can really help. 
Growing up was hard too, because I was in a conservative family who said I was lazy, and thought that by having surgery at 9 I was magically cured for life because God wanted it🥲

I don't even want to go out anymore because I feel like I'm just a target for people. I used to have 3 jobs, go on 10 mile hikes, walk across town, etc but now 5 years later I can barely stand long enough to do my own dishes. It's just very frustrating and scary. I really am struggling with feeling like a burden even though I know I'm not. 

Does anyone else feel like this? These are supposed to be the years that people my age go do crazy things, but my crazy things are just existing without feeling guilty doing regular people stuff. Like, I want a service animal but I also can't take care of like a dog or something like that ya know? It's just really hard and I feel kinda lost so I'm hoping to find some community on Reddit 🥲💖 I already talked to both my therapists about it.

Advice needed for disabled adventurer taking their first time long-haul flight,"Hello! My parents are looking to come to Australia this December for about a month but they are quite anxious about the journey. My mother struggles moving around, she has a disability card but is not at the stage where she would need a wheelchair.

So I am calling out to the Reddit community to ask for any tips or advice you would have to help us plan.

Help me survive the winter,"I am undiagnosed but I have a very hard time surviving the winter.  It's a little better now that I can drive and don't have to be out in the elements as long, but it's still an issue for me.  On top of this, my school built half of the classroom walls overnight and never fixed the HVAC so every hour it's a whole new climate.  I also walk with a cane and the lockers are broken so even if I got one it's a coin flip on whether I can open it or not.  Basically my school is falling apart more than my joints.

So now I need to figure out a way to survive the cold outdoors and sometimes cold indoors, while also being able to survive a heat wave at a moment's notice, and be able to carry everything I need for school and to wear.  I also need to eat ?  The school food is actual poison and it's a closed campus so I have to survive off of food I bring in and snacks.  And I have to carry all this.  

I cannot be missing as much school as I have in this past the winter always gets me

My condition ,"I never spoke out about this but I just want to talk about my condition because why not:)

 I always wanted to do so many things like to play tennis, wear a certain outfit, play piano, acting, dancing, and so much more but unfortunately I was born with one arm and also unfortunately I was bullied alot in elementary so basically all my life I've been hiding under a jacket or sweater to feel comfort and to lower the stares and looks I get in public places. Since my mom passed I kinda regret not keeping my promise to stop being ashamed and do what I want, which I tried but unfortunately I can't.
I don't think I'll get out of it soon since I'm too paranoid and ""shy"" I guess. 
I'm in high school and it's been a crazy ride, I've only had a few people ask me about it and ofc I tell them about it but I noticed how people are treating me. 
I'm not sure why ppl talk to me like I'm a lost puppy on the street but it's kinda frustrating because i see it clear as day they don't see me as an equal and unfortunately I'm used to that, I think most people look down on me and feel sorry for me which is fine but it's not like I have no arms haha.
I always wished I had two arms because I would be more confident and so outgoing like my mom when she was in school, but I can't, not like this.
My family always told me it was a ""blessing"" and yeah maybe but it's more of a curse to me. Like if I were to go up to someone to just talk to them or if my dad and I are getting tickets to see a movie people's eyes quickly spot my arm though it's hidden underneath the jacket, yes ofc ppl can tell but not always first glance so it's understandable if they keep looking. I was uncomfortable with this when I was younger, but now I see it's more because of curiosity and not like ""eww wtf"". 
Anyways, I'm making progress a little, I'm still hiding but I'm more open to sharing my hobbies and doing what makes me happy such as reading, writing books, doing yoga, painting, and dancing a little. I'm accepting and loving myself slowly, it's gonna be a while but I hope to one day be a better person. I'm an only child so I tend to figure out things myself like I've always done, so I'm sure I can do this, it's not like I need an ""extra hand"" you know hahaha.

Love/hate relationship with grocery delivery services,"I love the fact that we can order grocery delivery and etc. now, I do. I physically can't shop in the store anymore and I couldn't survive without delivery services. However, I've had so many mistakes with my deliveries. I get they happen, but I've had the following:

1. Shorted about $60-70 worth of frozen groceries. I had to physically go to the grocery store to sort it out, even though doing so crashed me and I could barely stand while I was waiting customer service to figure out what happened to my missing groceries.
2. Had a shopper buy me a three carton box of regular milk from Costco, when I clearly asked for lactose-free milk and marked no substitutions. I ended up with milk I couldn't drink and physically was incapable of returning it to the store. I did get a refund and had to give the milk away, but still didn't actually have milk that I could drink. I can only guess that the guy who shopped for me was completely clueless and had no idea there was a difference between lactose free and regular milk.
3. Refrigerated items a month past the expiration date.
4. Missing or wrong items.
5. Expired or close to expiring fresh vegetables or fresh vegetables/fruit that were close to rotten.
6. Had someone deliver both my groceries AND someone else's groceries to me. I was puzzled why I had so many bags and fortunately realized that they gave me things that I hadn't ordered before they left. I made my shoppers/delivery people stay while I had to sort through every bag and then give them back multiple bags that weren't mine. I then had to check and make sure that I wasn't charged for all of those items that weren't mine.

Like, is it too much to expect people to do the bare minimum to check for expiration dates, that items are correct, or edible in the case of fresh vegetables? I have so little spoons as it is and it's frustrating to keep having to deal with major delivery mistakes.

I just get so frustrated by my inability to go shopping myself, so that I'm not wasting my time or money on food that is bad/wrong/missing.",11,1eh3nig,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eh3nig/lovehate_relationship_with_grocery_delivery/,6,1722473729.0

What to do when HR denies accommodation and then refuses to tell you why in writing?,"I’m partially nonverbal auDHD, have auditory processing disorder and requested to use an AAC (a device that I can type into to speak on my behalf, like Stephen Hawking; it would also transcribe things that people say to me).

I want disabled people to be able to have physical community too. ,"This is a gentle rant. 

Tonight I was looking looking for an art class in my community. (My family has complained forever about the fact that I never leave the house. They don't understand the idea that there is nowhere for me to go) And I think about the fact that I would like to live a fuller life so I need to find activities to do. So I went to my local event website and I found one and it was even free, which is great for me, only to find out that it's in a really old building that has stairs and no accessible entrance. 

And this is what I mean by there is no place for me to go when my family asked why I don't leave the house. We have cultivated a society that sometimes gently, other times harshly pushes disabled people to the margins but calls it access because it exists. There is nothing that makes me wish I was ablebodied more than the fact the world is automatically open to ablebodied people. 

And the worst part is no matter how I explain this to my family. They will never ever get it and it's been like this all of my life.  Not to mention, they never made any effort when I was a kid to make sure that I was involved and exploring stuff because we were in poverty, and there are bigger things to worry about but sometimes I look at how much life I missed out on and now I'm forced to miss out on more so in the house I stay.

Advice? ,"I (23) am trying to figure out a rather complicated issue and could use some advice from this community. My sister (21) currently lives with my parents. She has been diagnosed with deletion of the short arm of chromosome 9 since she was 2, which came along with epilepsy, vitiligo, mild cp, legally blindness, ticks, and much more. My parents home is not a good place. Our mother is an opioid addict who abused all of us emotionally and financially, and me physically, while spouting that she was the perfect mother to the world. Many people saw through that but no one stepped up to help us. My mother's controlling abuse coupled with my younger sister's conditions essentially turned my younger sister into a super dependent which none of us fault her for. She cannot drive due to her diagnosis and struggled in school so my mother decided to drop her out of high school freshman year (I was away at college and no one told me till after) and has basically trapped her in the house since then. She has no community, no regular social interactions, no purpose, and you can see just how much that weighs on her. I used to take care of her when I lived at home and she still had that spark of life that I loved. I was on the track team and had her join the throwing team so that she could spend time with me after school. I'd take her out on sister dates, we shared a room all our lives, she mimicked everything I did and while younger me found it annoying, I learned to love it as I got older because she just wanted someone to show interest in her and want her around. She's my girl. I often consider her my child what with all that we've been through and how I had to take on a parental role very young. 

Now comes the parts where I could use advice: I want to move her in with me. I went to a service academy for college so I have no debt and work commercially in a very high paying field. I can afford to live practically anywhere in the US. I can afford to fully support her financially and that is my plan. I have a long term boyfriend (soon to be fiancé) that is 100% on board with this plan. We took her on a three week long trip to Disney and Universal Studios and Naples, FL so that she could get a reprieve from home and smile and so that I could see how she and my partner meshed and so that he could understand fully the level of commitment this decision is. And guys, he is all in :) I love that man. But the parts that are stumping me is the where, who, and whats:

Where do I buy a house to move her in with me? I've been researching best states for disability aid and care but the articles don't cover my points of interest. She needs to be able to get transportation whether that be by a state aid program (I know Delaware has motivCare and DART) or by public transportation. My goal is to give her the independence she never had and that means I don't want her to have to always rely on me to drive her places and feel guilty about doing so or unmotivated to do things because she doesn't want to be a bother (these were feelings our mother carved into us). This also plays into the quality of state programs and availability of care. Where have you found to be ideal areas to live that best suit your needs (she does not use any mobility aid so that is not a factor really) 

Who do I need to contact? She is currently on state disability insurance in Delaware but I know if I move her to another state ( which is the plan as Delaware is small and we do not want her to be in any proximity to our mother if I truly want to have success in her healing from it all) I have to transfer her benefits which as far as I know is only the insurance. I also want to set her up with a social worker so she gets the maximum benefit of advocacy for what is best for her and have no clue how to go about doing all of this. 

What do you think would be most beneficial to focus in on first? She does not need to work but I want her to have something that drives her, some passion or focus or goal and she has always wanted a job so I know I am going to be working on that with her but I don't think it should be my primary focus right off the bat of moving her to a new state. I have been looking into therapy specialties that might best apply to this situation as I am a strong advocate for therapy (have been in since I left home and it has helped bring back the light in my own eyes) and I believe that a trauma therapist would be best suited to start transitioning her out of the world my mother created for her. i understand this might be a controversial one but in the first 4 months of me being at college she gained almost 40lbs and it has gone up from there the longer I was away. I used to cook for the whole family and they resorted strictly to fast food and junk food when I left plus in hindsight all of the physical activity she did was when she would be mimicking me to spend time with me. And she had been diagnosed with depression a year into my time at college. All compounded together she has gained an unhealthy amount of weight that is further pressing on her existing diagnoses and making it hard for her to sleep and walk. She has told me how much she hates it. how much she hurts. But that she struggles with the food in the house and that she isn't allowed outside. It broke my heart when I first saw her after leaving for freshman year (for context I went to a 1 month bootcamp and then was not given my phone or social media access back till 8 months later as that is how my college ""indoctrinates"" you into the military) and I knew the moment I saw her that I had to get her out. That my worst fear of my mother turning on her in my absence had come true. But I want to get her involved in a workout class or a walking club or just anything she enjoys that keeps her active and I'll gladly be signing up with her if that is what she wants. Long and short of it: What aspects of moving her to a new area should I prioritize first. I obviously have a lot of goals and small things figured out but no grand plan and while everything does not have to go to plan, having one would greatly help me step into this. 

Thank you for reading all of this way and I appreciate any bits of advice. I love my sister so much and just want the best for her.  ",3,1egxm8o,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1egxm8o/advice/,0,1722458014.0

Excluded from family because of disability by brother [41/M]. What should I [34/F] do?,"Posted this in relationships and family first, but I didn't get a response...

My brother (41) and his wife (38) have made it quite clear that they don't want to see me for the past five years or so. They come to my parents' house a few times a year to visit, and when they're there, I can't visit.

They have a daughter (4) and a son (18 months), and as far as they know, I don't exist. They don't talk about me. They ask my parents (71 & 72/M & F) to remove photos of me when they visit. They think my brother is an only child.

Neither me or my parents have had any idea why this is going on. Both of my parents have asked my brother repeatedly about this, and he just stonewalls them. I have been ruminating about it for ages, trying to figure it out.

Something happened during a recent visit that revealed everything. My mum was serving her granddaughter some lunch, and she said to her, ""grandma, are you cold?"" My mum said something along the lines of, ""no sweetheart, there's just a part of my brain that doesn't work as well as yours"", and she was fine with that.

Both my mum and I have a hereditary essential tremor, which causes shaking. Mine is significantly worse than my mum's.

My brother got angry with her and said she can't say things like that around his daughter. My dad (able-bodied) overheard, and took my brother aside. He told him he can't speak to my mum like that. Then my dad clicked in, and asked if this was the reason I hadn't met his children.

My brother was sheepish, and yes, he and his wife want to protect their children from these things at such a young age, and considering we both have it, they don't want them to be fearful that they will also develop it.

It's worth noting that essential tremor isn't my only health issue - I have several, and they affect my balance and coordination to a noticeable extent. I also experience random jerking of my limbs. I also have invisible illnesses - SLE & endometriosis.

It was very clear that my SIL was bothered by this from the beginning - she used to stare at me across the table, and mum said she asked her many intrusive questions about my health.

Some background information - my SIL is very image-focused... spends a large portion of her income on designer bags and clothes. She's a lawyer. My parents are nothing like this. My brother is a politician and making his way up. Ironically, he advocates for disadvantaged Indigenous people.

They came to visit recently and my mum decided not to see them - she stayed with me the whole time. Afterwards they sent a framed photo of my dad and their kids without my mum in it.

I don't know how on earth people feel okay with themselves doing this and just so obviously treating disabled people poorly. I'd be willing to bet none of them would ever cut in front of an able bodied person.

Would I benefit from a cane?,"First time poster here, technically not disabled but didn't know where else to ask.

Can I use a mobilty aid at school without parent support.?,"So, I have Chronic pain. I've had chronic pain since around 5th grade. My mom told me it was growing pains for years and so I tried to ""walk it off"". when I eventually got her to try anything she took me to a rheumatologist who basically just said that it could be eds but my muscles are really tight and that it's not autoimmune. My hips are out of place, most likely due my limp, and so one of my legs appears longer.

I gave up really looking for a diagnosis years ago. It only disappoints me every time and every time it's a negative result it just reinforces my mom's belief that nothing is wrong.

My mom is neglectful, and I don't just say that to be hurtful, her medical neglect is bad enough that I had gallstones, they turned into pancreatitis, and then that pancreatitis got bad, and then it turned into necrotizing pancreatitis and she still wouldn't do anything and I had to call an ambulance for myself. 

That was all when I was 14. I got my gallbladder removed after I spent 2 weeks in the hospital and had a picc and an nj tube. She sent me back to school the day after my cholecystectomy.

Anyway, I'm in 10th grade now, I asked my mom about getting a mobilty aid and she said that she didn't think I needed it and that I'm ""not some cripple that needs to use a device to get around"". Reminder, I have a limp and a messed up gait, everyone I know, except apparently my mom, knows that and can openly see that when I walk.

Well, I stopped caring for her opinion awhile back and so I bought myself a cane anyway. Originally I wanted to talk with my physical therapist about getting her opinion since she's a medical professional but since the convo with my mom was a bust I didn't really have that option.

So, I have it, i made sure to get the right size, and I've practiced walking with it and made sure I knew how to use it right. School is starting soon and I want to use it there, does anyone know if I can bring it to school without having to get my mom involved?

"Scooter and chair OOP, thanks insurance. ","My doc wrote me a prescription for a power chair/scooter. The insurance has played tennis with this for months. I accepted a job teaching littles and need it. My disability did not take the same break. 

So I hit eBay and fb marketplace. I found a scooter that was all but new and a lift that the gal sold me that I paid her asking price. It was low enough for a Catholic school teacher to afford. Then I later found a power chair that had been used once and the owner decided it was too big and didn’t want to use it. (It’s perfect.). They also sold it to me for a great price. 

Insurance refused figure out if my very limited walking/standing/being in incredible pain triggers “medical necessity.”  So with limited means, I outdid them and found what I needed. I will be in the classroom, on field trips, going on dates with my husband and all the things that we really haven’t done because I couldn’t. It was a huge chunk of savings to do this.

Wife's Disability Eligibility ,"Obligatory throw away account

I don't know what to do at this point. My (31m) wife (33f) is diagnosed ASD, Bi-polar depression and a couple other diagnosis. We have been together for about 7 years, married less than a week. Over that time I've watched her make great strides in her mental health in a lot of areas but I've watched her regress in a lot of others.

Back in 2017ish she worked a data entry job and it was perfect for her. She put her headphones on, did her work and no one bothered her. She had the job for years and then they eliminated her position. The experience has traumatized her. The sudden yank of the rug out from under her still haunts her to this day. 

Over the years she has held multiple jobs. These range from retail jobs, to data entry and most recently tutoring as she has a Master's in writing. The problem is that because of her mental health issues she eventually runs into problems a couple months into any job she has. These include feeling targeted by coworkers and bosses because she misunderstood something, interacting with the public in general and just struggling with her depression. It gets to a point where she quits the job because it is just destroying her health, both physical (she has a GI issue that responds to her mental health episodes)and mental. This just causes the cycle to repeat itself every few months.

The most recent issue is when they announced that they wouldn't be bringing her back next semester at the college she's tutoring at due to budget issues. This has sent her into another spiral and I just don't know what to do at this point. 

We've looked at disability in the past but it was denied and we didn't think it was worth the appeal at the time. Now though I don't know if I'm convinced she can hold a job even in her field as seen by this most recent issue. I know a steady source of income would improve her mental health but I don't know how she can obtain that.

Would it be worth speaking to a disability lawyer? Does she have a valid case?

Short term disability leave coordination with Child bonding leave,"I am going to be a daddy and have a situation.


- I’m currently on STD leave due to some health situation of mine. I am on a therapy and being treated. I need to extend the leave because I have some medical procedure to be done in the next few weeks.

- I’m also expecting my first new born in less than a week time.

I called my HR to extend my STD leave and push the date for the bonding leave to start at the end of the STD. 
HR said that the bonding leave has to start on the day the child is born and can’t start later. If started later the leave will be counted starting on the date of birth, so extending STD would not be helpful at all.

I did go through my employee handbook and benefits book, but can’t find any specific information that says,

- bonding leave has to start on the birthing day.

- neither there is a statement that says bonding leave can start anytime after the child is born but within a year.

Through google searches, and gemini, I have one general idea that bonding leave can start after the baby is born, but there is lack of such statement (and specifically on my employer) that says it specifically.

I want to find that information and update the HR that I found the information.

I want to ask fellow redditors,

- Would state level policies actually determine when I can start my bonding leave?
- what other sources would be relevant in my case?

If you can help if I rather provided name of my employer and my state, I can do that over private chat.

I can't tell if I'm disabled or not ,"I've (21m) been having leg pain for 5 years and fadigue and headaches for one. Basically my legs hurts when walking/standing. It usually starts at the ankle and progresses through the rest of the leg, but sometimes it starts in other places, so it doesn't have much of a pattern. It usually starts after a few minutes of walking, max 15min, but sometimes it's immediate and sometimes it takes longer. It doesn't prevent me from walking, it's never bad enough that my legs just fail, but it makes walking and getting out of the house in general extremely uncomfortable. I have to look for places to sit every 20 min and hope it gets slightly better so I can continue, but once it starts, it doesn't stop until I'm seated of an hour at least. 


I've been to an orthopedist, podiatrist, osteopath, general practioner, gynecologist, and had my veins checked, and nothing, I was just given magnesium and extra support for my shoes. At some point I gave up, or more so just hoped it would get better.


I just want to go on walks and appreciate them and not be in fear of having to stand on the bus or have to wait for the next in hope it's less full. But since my pain isn't constant, is unpredictable and it doesn't stop me from doing anything, I don't feel like I'm disabled, or that I should get mobility aids or ask for a seat on the bus. I know disability looks different for anyone, but not even my parents take me seriously, I'm just told to exercise more. I feel like I'll never be taken seriously on mobility aids if all I have is leg pain. Once my insurance is settled, I'll try and get second opinions, but I feel so lost.

"Access Pass For Disabled Individuals (National parks, BLM, and Forest Service), Free Lifetime Entrance","If you didn't know and you have been diagnosed with a permanent disability, you can get the [Access Pass](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/accessibility/interagency-access-pass.htm) - a no cost lifetime pass that grants free entrance to US National Parks and other Federal Recreational Lands (BLM, Forest Service, US Corp of Engineers, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Reclamation). It covers the pass-holder and if entrance fees are charged per vehicle, up to 4 adults in a noncommercial car along with them. It also sometimes provides discounts on other amenities within those parks like campsites.

I just got mine today and it was even easier than I thought it would be. I just visited the BLM office in my town, pulled up my ssdi ""proof of income"" letter on the SSA portal website showed them my ID matching my name on the letter and scrolled down to the part of the letter that said I receive it for disability, and Poof pass in my hand. This means me and my spouse will be taking a three day trip into Yellowstone part and saving $70 in entrance fees. If we decide to go down to Grand Tetons National Park below it, oh that would be free too. 

And it's good for life.

I feel like there aren't many ""perks"" to being disabled despite what many people think about us getting the ""best parking"". This really is a nice treat though, so along with the fact that my wheelchair cruises at 4-5mph which is faster than most people walk- I'll take it thanks! 

The caveats are:

* must be a US citizen or permanent resident
* be medically determined to have a permanent disability that severely limits one or more major life activities
* show proof of the above such a letter from your Dr, award letter from SSDI, SSI or the VA, Voc Rehab, or another state or federal agency (it must state that you are disabled)
* show a valid US ID such as Driver's License, State ID, Passport

How:

* get a pass in person at many agency offices and some park offices (list online) for free, you'll walk out pass in hand
* apply for a pass by mail (this option has  $10 processing and postage fee), pass will be mailed to you
* apply for a pass online (this options also has a $10 processing and postage fee), pass will be mailed to you

What Won't Work:

* you can't get one with just your disabled parking permit sadly

Question about LT disability coverage through employer,"Hi,

I am hoping for some advice from this great community on my situation and the language in my long term disability policy through my employer.

Background: I have diagnoses from my psych for PTSD, anxiety & depression. Stemmed from being sexually abused for years by a gymnastics coach. I have been in therapy and seeing a psych for a couple years and on medication, so diagnoses i’m sure are in my medical records.

I started a new job in Nov 2023. 
I have been really struggling with my condition of late, with severe anxiety, panic attacks, social anxiety, and debilitating depression that is affecting my ability to maintain my work and parenting responsibilities, although my performance at work is ok (part of my anxiety is I am constantly in fear of bad performance, losing my job, etc which paralyzes me and causes me to panic, dissociate and be terrified to interact with people. The dissociation is affecting my ability to remember simple instructions, drive without getting lost, etc. Therapy and medications are not really helping so far and I am worried about my financial ability to provide for my 2 kids and so I have looked into the disability insurance provided through my employer (provided by Lincoln)

My long term disability insurance through my employer (provided by Lincoln) reads as follows:

“Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion(s)

This policy will not cover any Disability or Partial Disability:

1. Which is caused by, or results from, a Pre-Existing Condition; AND

2. Which begins in the first 12 months immediately after the covered person’s effective date of coverage.”

The policy does cover mental health for up to 24 months. It says they do a 90 look back from your start date to see if a diagnosis is pre-existing

My question: Does this mean I am never eligible for disability coverage because I have been treated for these diagnoses before I started my job? Or does it mean I could be eligible come Nov 2024, when I have been with the company 12 months? The “AND” in part 1 is confusing to me.

Would REALLY appreciate help on what this language means from those of you who know the legal stuff in these policies. 

I’m feeling pretty desperate and just want to know if this is even an option for me come November 2024 when I have been with the company for a full year.

"sharing my Experience after Life-Changing Accident, I was living my life normal never feel regret  of any thing but now recently it is  creating anxiety, can someone give me advice who already have the similar kind of  situation. ","At the age of 10, I experienced a significant accident that nearly resulted in the loss of my foot. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the medical team, my foot was saved. However, the structure of my foot was permanently altered, and one toe was lost (image attached). 

Now, at 23 years old, I have no memory of the incident and live my life without any feelings of shame or regret. Even I am  academically always performing great and take pride in my scholarly achievements. I am able to walk normally, and my condition is not noticeable to others. Despite this, my foot remains weak, and I am unable to run or engage in sports for extended periods. In social situations, I often feel uncomfortable, which has recently led to increased anxiety and difficulty in forming new friendships.

Disabilities from different cultural POVs?,"Hi Reddit,

It seems like there is a long history of shunning or hiding people with disabilities, but are there any places in the world where that isn't the case? Or perhaps even celebrated?

NES Emulator for iPhone: Now with Experimental Facial Recognition Accessibility!,"I'm excited to announce the release of NiN10 the first NES emulator available to play on Apple Watch!

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nin10/id6503959130

This update brings several bug fixes and improvements, along with an exciting new accessibility feature: facial recognition. This experimental feature aims to enhance accessibility by allowing users to control the emulator using facial expressions.

I'm eager to hear feedback from the community to help me refine this feature. As it stands, the facial recognition can detect the following gestures:

* Head rotation and eye tracking for movement
* Opening your mouth, raising your eyebrows, and winking with the left or right eye for button inputs

Please note that since this is an experimental feature, there may be some issues or bugs. Your feedback will be invaluable in helping us improve it.

Thank you for your support and happy gaming with NiN10!

How to Make Abled Partner Feel Cherished,"Hello! I am 28 years old and I have ankylosing spondylitis (AS) along with some pretty debilitating mental health issues and audhd (autism + adhd). 

I felt like this would be the best place to get some advice from fellow disabled friends and potentially abled partners that are in this sub! My partner is 27, able bodied, and is the working one. We currently live with her dad for the moment so stuff like doing household chores isn’t really an issue because her dad keeps the house pretty much spotless. I just gather dishes from the bedroom and take them when I’m able to. 

I just want to make her feel loved and appreciated and cherished. I tell her how much I love her and appreciate her all the time and how much she does for me and supports me, but I want to do something special for her! I have no income of my own, so gifts or things of the sort are pretty iffy since it kind of just feels like I’m taking her money to buy her something. 

Looking for cheap, fun things we can do together that aren’t too hard on the body and can help me show her that I am so so so grateful for everything she does for me. Please leave suggestions and such! Appreciated. ❤️ ",18,1efxnq5,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1efxnq5/how_to_make_abled_partner_feel_cherished/,10,1722356600.0
How to prevent concussions,"I'm not looking for medical advice but any non medical strategies you might use to help you. 

I currently have my 4th or 5th concussion I've had in the last 6 months. I'm not sure exactly, it's hard for me to remember at the moment.

I can't figure out how to keep them from happening. I have episodes, somewhere between fainting and a functional seizure, where I essentially lose control of my body and fall or hit against things around me. I'll shake/spasms to the point that even if I'm just sitting or even sometimes laying I hit my head multiple times in a short period, which is how I've gotten most of my concussions. 

This concussion was caused because an episode started while I was on the stairs so I had to half slide half fall down the stairs to prevent a worse injury, and then I sat/laid on the bottom step for more than an hour before I recovered enough to ask for help to get safely back to my room.

I have some warning before these episodes but one of the first signs is I loose a lot of motor control, which includes my ability to talk clearly, so I can't really communicate what's going on to people around me to ask them to help in the moment. I also generally can't walk to a safe environment once the episode has began. So generally I'll try to sit or lay down the best I can, but I often still end up hitting my head either on the way down or after I've laid down just trying to move at all. 

I also just have full body tics/spasms where I'll kinda stumble backwards until I hit something, often with my head. 

What I'm diagnosed with is FND that causes these, but that doesn't really tell me what to do about them. 

I just don't know what to do to prevent this. I can't keep it up because multiple concussions is not good or sustainable. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can manage this? I am also going to the doctor in a couple days and I'm going to discuss it with them, but so far no doctor has had anything more helpful than ""try to lay down when it's happening"".

Getting over the fear of learning to drive again after becoming disabled from a car accident. Any similar experiences? ,"I got into a severe car crash over 5 years ago, and when I woke up I learned both of my legs needed to be amputated above the knee. 

I was devastated, and I knew I had a very long road ahead of me in terms of recovery, but I accepted the situation and tried to bottle the trauma. I eventually got prosthetic legs, had them gradually upgraded as I re-learned how to walk, and I'm happily independent now. I practice walking daily, am living with my wife, have a remote professional job, and plan on starting a family. 



Regardless, since the accident, I developed a deep fear of getting in the driver's seat again, feeling a sense of guilt and self-hate at myself. Initially, I felt infantilized by my family who felt that I shouldn't be driving with no legs, but after seeing the modern ease of accessibility for amputees, they changed their mind. However, I myself could never fully shake off the fear and the embarrassment at myself for having lost my legs in my prime due to car accident. Although my family modified my car to include hand controls and I worked with my OT to get my prosthetics suitable for driving, I still rarely drive for this reason.



Given that I plan on starting a family, I can't keep on pushing off necessary responsibilities forever out of fear at this point, and need to fully push towards getting my life back together from before my accident. I have begun taking initiative with very short distance drives about once a month and my anxiety about it has been slowly easing, and my wife has been extremely supportive along the way, but I'm wondering if anyone else has been in a similar spot before.",11,1efxy1k,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1efxy1k/getting_over_the_fear_of_learning_to_drive_again/,2,1722357291.0

My disability is ruining my life,"I was born with a bone deformity. 

All my joints are a bit out of place, which means they dislocate real easily. My bones break easier too. I can't lift heavy stuff, just cat litter is too much. I can't run, I can't make any twist motions, so no roller, no bicycle, no skiing, almost no dancing ect.

Apps like Finch and Moodle made me realize through writing prompts, that my childhood dreams have all been stopped by my disability. 

I always wanted to skate and roller skate because of Tony Hawk's games. I've also always wanted to do burlesque and be a dancer. None are possible for me.

Years of physical therapy didn't help much. You can't fix displaced bones. Stretching worsen my joint instability, so I can't even be flexible.

I'm really, very good at art, since I couldn't move much since birth. But it's not bringing me the joy I seek. 

I've wanted to move, dance, be super flexible and skate before understanding that I was badly disabled. God knows I tried and hurt myself badly many times when I was a kid.

I can't even play skating games or go see burlesque shows anymore, because of how bitter it makes me.

I also get this desire to move and release pant up energy or negative emotions. The best alternative I found was to sing very loudly (even though I'm terrible at it lol).

Starting out with mobility aids,"This is my first time posting here kinda nervous but I want to start using mobility aids to help me. I have hypermobility and am being referred to a specialist to confirm if it is EDS, I'm suspected to have POTs too and I have a chronic pain disorder.

I've practically been ignored in terms of my health and they are reluctant on me using mobility aids such as crutches or a cane. I'm moving out next month so hopefully I can get the support I need when I move. I've been using compression bandages but they don't work aswell so I'm thinking of getting more sturdy knee braces as I think it'll help with my walking.

"I can’t wash my own hair, should I cut my hair short? ","I have severe fibromyalgia (among other things) and lately, exasperated by a job I physically can’t keep up with and am not able to use my mobility aids at, it’s gotten so bad it’s nearly unmanageable. I feel like I’m just crying every day because the pain is so bad but an issue I’m having particularly recently is weakness and pain in my arms. I’ll try carrying something like a half gallon of tea to my fridge and it just burns with pain from the exertion, or pick up tongs and doing motions ro cook my food at kbbq; everyday average actions and motions are becoming so so painful, but the thing hurting a lot is washing my hair. I’m autistic with medium support needs and especially as a kid I always struggled to take care of myself and as an adult I’m really sensitive to looking greasy or smelling bad. As a kid I used to her big rats nests from struggling to shower and brush my own hair that would then have to be forcibly and painfully brushed out by a parent or cut out, and my hair was often forcibly cut short because I couldn’t take care of it and the cut off ponytails were kept by my parent and shown to me in a baggie as a reminder of how bad I was at taking care of my hair/self. I guess because of this I feel really sensitive about my hair in general. I’ve been struggling so much to wash my hair and it hurts so much I’ve been considering just cutting it short but I also have been trying to grow it out for so long even though I know it’s not very healthy hair and it’s pretty damaged. 
I just don’t see another solution other than cutting it short because washing it is so painful. I don’t wash it every day but it can’t be avoided, I know I’d have to wash it even if short but at least then it would be less and I won’t be having to keep my arms held up at my head as long as I do now, which is the thing I’m struggling with. 
I have a shower chair but it’s the physical act of raising my arms and doing hand movements that I’m struggling so much with; my arms just get so weak and tired and they start to burn and ache it’s so painful. I guess I’m just here to rant. If you’ve been in a similar position as me I’d love to hear from you. I feel like my hair is how I express myself the most, I like to color it fun colors, but I also just struggle so much to take care of it because of the pain so that also means styling it in ways I want or doing extra hair care like oil or conditioning treatments; it’s just too much energy/work I don’t have. 😔

Short Term Disability While Figuring Out Dignosis,"I am working with Lincoln Financial insurance that is provided through my employer. 

I had been seeing my PC doctor about a month before my first claim was filed in April. She started the process of referring me to a Rheumatologist due to symptoms and blood work and signed off on claim #1 for a week of std that was approved. Rheum was only able to get me in June. 

Rheum appointment was early June and suspected autoimmune/ Rheumatoid Arthritis more testing to be done. 

During this time in June I tried returning to work for two weeks and thing suddenly got so much worse. And I filed another claim early July due to horrible symptoms. 


But, scheduling bloodwork and more testing/appointments is slow and hard to get on the schedule. 

Lincoln wants medical documents and I’m assuming a concrete diagnosis. 

We are obviously in the process of doing that. 

But, I’m not getting paid because they want more documents/ different documents, on top of horrible communication, stalling, losing documents and not telling me what they need. 

I’m stressing that they will deny me for the month and a half I am out because I don’t have an official diagnosis- just what my doctor suspected at first- Raynauds which didn’t end up being the case. Rheum is in early testing since then and my next appointment isn’t for a while. I’m still super sick. 


This is all really hard for me to understand and Lincoln gets short with me like I should know all the terminology. 

Any advice for how to explain and prove I am unwell enough to not work when doctors are still working on diagnosing? 

Do I have to have specific diagnosis DURING the time of my leave? 

What can I ask my doctor for and should I anticipate being taken advantage of being denied by Lincoln?

Seeking thoughts on a self determination tactic by a group home.,"A supportive housing setting manager requested that a young adult with Intellectual Disability refrain from raising concerns with family even though the concerns are not being addressed or are not being addressed in a timely manner. The excuse was that it was in the young adult with the Disability’s best interest to not bother the parent with their concerns.

The parent became aware of the issue on their own observation during a visit but said nothing, then the person with ID mentioned it as a concern and thus the parent notified the parties responsible as a heads up that the concern remains a health and safety issue. Thus the home felt warranted to request that concerns (there were others) not be raised with the parent.

We tell kids don’t listen when someone tells you to keep secrets from your parents. While an argument could be made that this is in aid of self determination, I feel that this request hovers over a thin line as ID persons are not generally cognitively higher than a 5th grader. As a result they wouldn’t be able to rationalize what can and cannot be said to the parent and may not feel comfortable seeking help when most needed for fear of breaking this arbitrary rule imposed on them.

I'm still trying to work and I hate it. It feels like I spend every hour away from work trying to recover from it. But with no definitive answers, how do I file for any kind of disability assistance? Ugh...

How to live a fulfilling life when in a wheelchair?,"I’m not trying to be dramatic! And I know that if people knew me irl they’d probably say that I am better off than a lot of people (physically) but recently I can’t help but feel completely hopeless.

Long story short - I’m in a wheelchair and I just don’t see much hope for a fun life in the future.

I live at home, in a small town with nothing around it. I’m not a millionaire so I can’t just pay my way to a simple life of freedom. There’s no public transport and if there was, where would I go? And why?

And the thing that pisses me off the most - even if I do go outside far from home I have to either: A) dehydrate myself or B) plan my day around drinking water and going to the bathroom or C) just not bother. All because of stupid public toilets and their lack of accessibility.

I have no friends. I have no reason to go outside and get a life. I don’t even know how to, but I also kind of do…?

It’s a mixture of my personality and my disability. I think my personality that holds me back mentally accounts for the lack of mental disability so you know just to get the full package of “hey you’re physically held back….and also your mindset is fucked”

So how do I ever look at the future and have hope? How do I have confidence that I’m not going to waste my life? How do I get my own life? How do I change? When will I finally be comfortable in my life and free. 

It’s not just a matter of thinking “I’m not behind in life”. No I guess not, but it’s not like I could suddenly change my life. Certainly doesn’t feel that way anyway.

UGH I want to go out ALONE. I want to go on solo trips ABROAD. I want to explore life. Be free. Be an adult. 

I’m so tired of this. ",5,1effpq7,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1effpq7/how_to_live_a_fulfilling_life_when_in_a_wheelchair/,12,1722299465.0

What do you look forward to?,"I’m still in the middle of the process of adjusting to having limited mobility for an undefined, potentially indefinite amount of time. I’m 8.5 months in and I notice that a decent part of the damage to my mental health is from not feeling like I have anything to look forward to, because most of the things I used to look forward to are effectively not possible anymore since most of them required well…normal mobility.

All of my mindspace is just focused on managing my day-to-day in terms of managing pain, keeping up at work, keeping up with physical therapy, and trying to not make my condition worse. I don’t know what to strive for or dream about anymore. All I see are current and future increasing responsibilities that I’m not sure I’ll be able to handle in light of my capabilities decreasing. I still watch videos and read about stuff I’m interested in as a distraction, but since I can’t take part in these things anymore, they aren’t things I look forward to anymore.

what counts as needing assistance on ADLs? ,"so I have declined a lot lately in my health, and when asked I keep saying that i’m independent but i’m not sure if I am anymore. I’m just gonna run down the list to see if i’m doing okay or worse then I thought. (I recognize I could just be in major denial because I hate asking for help with things) 

1. Bathing: I still can technically due this unassisted but I’ve had to reduce the amount of showers I take to every other other day or every 3 days because it’s so exhausting and even the showers I do take have gotten to where my hair is still greasy afterwards cause it’s too exhausting to throughly wash it. My beard and hair are also a mess because I haven’t been able to leave the house to go to a barber or had the energy to style it or shave. (I have also been using a lot of bath wipes) 

2. Dressing: I can get clothes on and off independently but I often end up wearing them days on end due to reasons above

3 Feeding: I get 100% of calories from my feeding tube, I can normally set up the feeds by myself but I keep missing days due to falling asleep before it’s set up. 

4 Toileting: so far doing okay with this one, no accidents but occasionally need help to get to the bathroom. (not very often) 

5 Moving around: I use a wheelchair for any distance longer then across a room, and a crutch for anything shorter then that. In all reality I don’t move around that much anymore though. I was working 10 hours a week on an extremely easy job but had to quit a few days ago due to ems having to be called for the second time on me at work. I spend around 70% of my day in bed and the rest on the couch or practicing piano. 

6 transferring: seems okay, I haven’t fallen in a way that’s killed me or broken any bones 🤷🏼‍♂️ 

(for more context I also haven’t been able to do household chores like the majority of laundry or dishes. I can fold the laundry and put it in drawers but I can’t get to the washing machines because they are downstairs, so my roommates have had to take on a lot of my chores)

"Do you know any programs that will take in, train, and rehome service dogs? ","I got a dog in the begging of November last year with the intention of training her to be my service dog, but we arent a good match.

We've got her to the point that she is mostly neutral about people. Is good about leaving food alone. Gives good attention when working (with a few distractions - she needs more training when it comes to other dogs or people calling out to her.) She sits when weve been stopped for too long, lays down if its longer. She has a decent down stay but its not perfect. She provides pressure well, and comes up and nudges and licks and distracts when having a panic attack/breakdown/ptsd responce. It doesnt have to be visibly an issue either. She knows how to check rooms, and gaurds behind you when your back is to a door. She sits outside of the bathroom if youre in a house, and does great in public stalls even if theyre the small ones. 
Shes not perfect (she still gets excited about her food, and about other dogs) but would do well with a proper trainer, and I genuienly think she would be a great service dog for someone, its just not working out for us as a pair. 

That being said if you know of a program that would take her in and finish her training I would love to know.

Should I consider mobility aids?,"Hey! So i guess for context, im a 17 yr old AFAB(now nb), and i live in the UK. I have scoliosis of a 23° angle if that means anything to anyone, and i have hypermobility. 

While i was younger, my disabilties were mostly manageable, though sometimes/during different activities, it was almost unbearable due to pain. Now that im older, i feel like my symptoms are gradually worsening. 

For the last maybe 4 years, things like walking for more than 20 minutes nonstop becomes painful, and anything more than an hour brings me to tears. The pain is mostly in my lower back(where my curvature is), the connection point of my back to my hips, and any other connection point in my legs. Standing still becomes agony after a while, i cant  lie on solid ground(grass, carpet floor ect) for more then a few minutes without having to be pulled up and literally yelling from the sudden burst of pain from my hips. Sometimes even my bed is uncomfortable to lie on my back with. My knees generally have been playing up more, and all of my joints have been aching regularly from nothing in particular. 

The most worrying thing for me has been that my legs buckle, usually at the knees. Now, theyve been doing this occasionally for a few months, but only a week ago, i had a weird time where they just started giving out constantly. About halfway through the day at school(i do art and usually stay in the same building so i hadnt been going up many stairs or anything, i was just working) i got up to stretch my legs like i do usually, but as i was pacing the room, i got a slight twinge in my hip, and felt one of my knees buckle. It wasnt enough to make me fall, but i stumbled before being able to right myself. I didnt lose use of my leg for very long at all, it just gave out and then started working again, but it was considerably more unstable. I ushered myself to my chair and sat down while i tried to figure out why it did that. After a minute i got up again, and felt like i couldnt balance easily at all, like enough to make me sit back down. As the day went on, this continued to happen, swapping between both legs, and generally feeling pretty unstable. I fell down once because of the buckles, and had quite a few close calls. My friends were concerned enough that they wouldnt let me carry my hot food. It was happening about 10 times every 15-20 mins, and lasted for a few hours. Kind of unrelated but my neck was also jerking every so often(i have this thing where my neck will suddenly jerk so my head is resting on one of my shoulders, but its not very concerning to me). Ever since then my knees have sort of been weird, they ache more than they did before hand. 

My friends think I need a cane, and im inclined to believe them, but im not sure. I guess because my syptoms ""arent that bad"" i feel a little like a poser asking for a mobility aid, but on the other side, i know that i probably either need that or some intervention. My mum is supposed to be calling a physiotherapist, as my doctor has told me that would be the best cause of action. 

But if im honest, im starting to think i might need more than a cane and some physiotherapy. But im honestly not sure, i guess im asking someone who might have more experience than i do.

Are we overreacting?,"
I have a nephew that has a neurological disability and has been called the hard r word by his own family. They allow this child to watch a YouTube puppet named Jeffrey.

The puppet is purchasable.

Advice on Living Arrangements and Home Assistance,"I am a disabled veteran in Georgia with a 90% rating, waiting for an appeal that will get me to 100%, receive payments from a commercial disability insurance policy from my last employer, and I am waiting for a decision on SSDI. My symptoms have been slowly getting worse for over 20 years but over the last six months, enough of them have gotten bad enough that I am no longer independent. Should I consider asking a family member to move in, live here for free, and provide me support? Or instead should I look to hire someone to provide the support and care I need?  
  
For example, up until about two years ago, I would have one or two periods lasting 3-10 days each for any year where I was too symptomatic to drive myself, make food, clean, do laundry, etc. I would just ask for help from friends and family for those few days. Last year, the periods go a little more severe and more frequent - it happened about every other month. But for the past month, I have now had symptoms get so bad that they impact daily life and they aren't going away. 

If it matters, I have Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) and have to get IVIg infusions every three weeks to slow to lose of use of my muscles. I also have peripheral sensory neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy that is slowly worsening. I have COPD and Asthma, GERD, PTSD, Fibromyalgia, Hemolytic Anemia, and horrible fatigue with brain fog. Physical exertion caused my O2 to drop and I get light-headed, dizzy, fatigued, and start wheezing. If I don't stop, my O2 drops low enough that I pass out. Even if I do stop, it takes days for me to recover from my muscles aching, feeling full, clumsiness, horrible muscle spasming, and muscle and joint pain.   
  
Mental exertion gives me migraine headaches after about 30-45 minutes that take hours to days to go away. Reading a book or even having to focus too hard filling out a form for too long can trigger this. Heck - even playing a strategy video game for more than about 30 minutes can trigger it.

My quality of life has dropped super low - I'm basically a lump that watches TV and occasionally plays video games - but my therapist does a good job helping me maintain perspective and keep a good attitude. 

But it has been over five weeks now that they symptoms have been their worst and it isn't letting up or getting better like it always has before. I can't get in to see my Neurologist until January, the Rheumatologist and Hematologist have both given the ""everything within my specialty is being managed"", and the Pulmonologist has ordered a new Pulmonary Function Test that I take on Thursday. Pain Management has taken away the Percocet they previously prescribed for breakthrough pain and left me with just the Belbuca twice a day that used to manage my pain but now leaves me constantly at a pain level of 5-9 at any given moment. Oh, and the Neurologist stopped the muscle relaxers two appointments ago because I was still having spasms even on the maximum dose.  
  
I am now at the point that I am struggling to even wipe myself after going to the bathroom (have been recommended a bidet) or even make it across the room. Cooking, laundry, cleaning, driving, etc. is all out of the question. I can still wash myself in a bath but fear falling too much to shower anymore -- but washing is a struggle. Heck, when my pain is REALLY bad, even taking my meds and brushing my teeth is a struggle. 

I have four adult children but two each have a child under one year old and the other two are ... not dependable. When they previously offered to help and I took up the offer, they didn't help. 

My daughter with the older child has said that if I buy a house with an in-law suite, she would be willing to move her family (her, her husband, the toddler) into the rest of the house and she would take care of me. It's a very generous offer, but I'm nervous that once I make that decision and we move in, I am stuck with that solution for the rest of my life. If she runs into problems, I'm stuck with no backup. I think she is more excited about the prospect of a free house and a potential stipend from the VA for providing my care.

Where do I start on getting assistance? I think the VA has a hotline I can call. Do I start there? How does one find people you can trust to come into your home and provide assistance or drive you around when you can't take care of yourself? What red flags do I look for and what do I do if I see them once I invite these helpers into my home?

Should I be looking at an assisted living situation? I'm only in my 50s but I was considering a 55+ community anyway.

However, when my mental health declines or life feels heavy, I have a hard time doing the things to care for my body like remembering to take my medication, use my cpap, or just generally care for myself. Of course, then I just feel worse because my body isn't getting the care it needs. Does anyone else face this issue? What helps?

LTD and going back to work in a different job,"Has anyone here ever had an “own occupation” type of disability policy and actually used it where they went back to work in a different job and different industry?

I was previously the President of a defense contracting company and am going to go work as a director in a non-profit that is local to my community.

I have spoken with my insurance company and my claims manager is certain that this would be considered a different occupation so it would fall under the “own occupation” clause.

It offers a much lower salary and has vastly different job requirements that will not be as grueling on me physically and will allow me to do something useful with my time.

I never thought one injury would change my life so much for so long ,"I torn my ACL, MCL and injured MM when I fell down on uneven ground after a jump. I was playing badminton with my friends. Then I fell, heard a “pop” sound and my knee had lost stability. I wasn’t able to bend it fully, the pain was there but I was pumped with adrenaline. I walked 3 km home. Then it only got worse. 5 days after injury I went to the hospital after my USG and X-ray results came back. I got a mechanical brace and two crutches. Most likely I’m gonna need surgery.

It feels so weird that one moment, one fall has consequences that severe. On the X-ray I found out I have significant degenerative changes in my joint. It made me think that yes in fact I experienced joint pain since I was a kid once a while but I had never given it much thought. 

I’m an active person. I loved walking. I often climb - mostly bouldering. I go to the gym often. My legs were always something I was proud of. I could lift very heavy. I got visible muscles even with father high BF%. I try to cheer up myself that I still can do a big part of my usual activities but deep down I’m terrified and in denial. 

It’s all new to me. I feel weird when people are giving me dirty looks when I take my crutches in one hand and walk upstairs without them. It’s like I feel they think that i’m “faking”(?) or maybe it’s just my intrusive thoughts. ",161,1ee3ok2,disability,https://i.redd.it/s93lsdb5c8fd1.jpeg,34,1722159423.0
Best affordable brands or types of wheelchair for children?     ,"
My cousin is disabled. She doesn’t know how to walk but does move around so I’m trying to find a chair with some sort of lock or safety feature that won’t let her fall if she moves around on it.
The issue is they live in Kurdistan Iraq and are living below the poverty line even for Kurdish standards. I’ve been trying to reach out to companies and nonprofit groups and more to try to find a solution but it’s been really difficult. Does anyone also know any groups or discounted cites that are able to do shipping for an affordable cost? I can afford to pay 200$ but if something is a little higher and decent I can try to get more to spend.

Cane using family member seems to be slamming it down while walking,"A family member of mine now needs a cane for walking. I'm glad they are using an aid, but I've been in an awkward and frustrating situation because of it. 

When they walk, they slam the cane down heavily into the floor. As a result of the magnitude of the sound, I've been getting frequent migraines whenever I'm with them. The mix of loud, sudden sharp noise and overstimulation of it's frequency has made me hyper focused on the sound and personally miserable. I suspect they are not effected as much by the sound because of their hearing.

Not only is it disruptive, I'm starting to worry that it may be indicative to improper cane use. Slamming it like that could be hurting their arms and hands, or perhaps they are not using it properly for their need.

The problem is, I've mentioned it once before and they told me they can't stop. I'm now horribly terrified of asking or inquiring further and I've been avoiding them in order to stop the migraines. I just want to tell them in a way that doesn't come out as offensive, insulting, or embarrassing.

What is the best way to portray disability in creative writing?,"Hi, I'm a (non-disabled) creative writer who is currently planning out a story where there are multiple disabled characters (or at least, considered ""disabled"" in their world.) I want to portray these disabilities as realistically and respectfully as possible. I'm sorry if this post is too long.

Here is my current philosophy on writing disabled characters - please point out anything I need to change or add, I'd LOVE to hear it.

- **A character shouldn't be defined by their disability.** Their disability doesn't make up their identity. There's so much more to them other than ""character with so-and-so condition"". Example: This character is female, likes golf, is a cat lover, very enthusiastic and energetic, and is deaf in one ear. The ""deaf in one ear"" part doesn't define her whole character.

- **They should still be treated like normal people despite being accommodated.** They shouldn't be showered with sympathy and pity every waking moment of their lives.

- **If they do something bad, their disability doesn't exempt it.** In accordance with the point above, being disabled doesn't excuse bad actions. 

- **A disability isn't an ""all or nothing"" thing.** Characters can be *partially* disabled.

- **Disabilities don't need backstories.** Long, tragic backstories aren't necessary. 

- **Simple things normal people overlook can be extremely difficult for those with certain disabilities.** I'm definitely planning on having ""normal"" people (or people who are considered normal in that world, at least) interact with the disabled people and gradually understand that simple things, like putting on your shoes, communication, etc. can be much harder for them.

- **Depending on culture, stereotypes, etc. disabled people will probably be treated badly in certain cases.** (Or, in reverse - disabled people are treated with too much sympathy to the point where it becomes sickening).

- **No, you don't have to ""magically cure"" the disabilities for the sake of yay, happy ending!** I hate this trope if you want me to be honest, unless it's done super well.

(I feel like I'm missing a lot of important points here.)

Current ideas for characters:

- A young boy whose medical condition prevents him from using a specific ability called ""True Singing"", which makes him ""disabled"", as well as gives him other physical side effects that impact him on a daily basis (I'm thinking chronic pain or mobility issues). Despite this, he's managed to create a fulfilling life outside of his disability, even collaborating with other professional ""True Singers"". He actually gets along with them pretty well and hates receiving pity for his disability.

- A deeply embittered woman who is part of a faction of those who are ""disabled"", typically for being incapable of using the ""True Singing"" ability. She is somewhat antagonistic, treating anyone who is ""normal"" terribly and also being infuriated at other disabled individuals who don't passionately hate the ""normal"" people. Pretty much everyone in the outcast faction hates her for her terrible attitude and complete lack of empathy despite being considered disabled themselves.

Anything else I should add? Please let me know.

How to explain invisible illness,"My partner is disabled. He suffers from very severe migraines, joint paint and chronic fatigue. He's an ambulatory wheelchair user. He also has a number of mental issues. 

We recently moved in together and my family is struggling to understand.

They ask me how I know it's not psychosomatic, or they say stuff (even directly to him) like ""You don't look in pain"". Sometimes they mean well, sometimes not, in any case it's troublesome and doesn't help him at all.
Even the dr at his latest appointment asked him if he was in pain at that moment because he didn't look like he was in pain (he was masking just to function).

And then if he can't mask or has flare ups they're just taken aback by it. Like, if he has to go to the bathroom to throw up, or is suddenly moaning on the stairs, they'll come ask me if I know and why I'm not doing something about it,  and I'm like ""cause that's normal for him and part of our bad day routine?"".

Most recently I had an argument with my dad because he showed up to our house without warning, rang the doorbell and my bf ignored it because he didn't know who it was. 

He came to me saying I have to explain to him that it's rude not to go open the doorbell. My bf was in bed, having a bed day, getting up takes him 10-15 minutes and there's a flight of stairs to go see who's at the door. That takes a lot of energy, not to mention the fact that his routine experience is that by time he gets to the door whoever it was has already left, so he just ignores the doorbell, unless it's a planned visit (in which case he's usually already up and waiting somewhere near the door).

How do I explain this so they'd understand?

My dad is old and hyperactive, he never understood the fact that people need rest and always call everyone lazy for stuff like sleeping until 10 on the weekend.
I dunno how to explain to him that my bf is not being rude or lazy if he doesn't get up to say hello.
(That's all he wanted, the visit wasn't for anything he needed).

My partner’s internalized ableism is making me miserable and I don’t know how to address it without getting shut down,"My (29F) partner (34M) and I both got diagnosed with ADHD last year. I think both of us knew something was afoot after a few years of starting to consume disability content. Lots of “huh, that sounds like me” when other people shared their stories. We both got assessed—my partner did it about 6 months before I did—and once he had a diagnosis, I think it was a huge relief for him. Having answers is great and can explain a huge amount of struggle, so I was thrilled for him. 

He has been homebound with GAD and depression for about three years and now has this ADHD diagnosis. During this time, I have been supporting us on a single income, doing a majority of the housework, cooking most meals, etc. I am in a graduate program earning a degree in my current field, I work a full-time design job, and I also teach college classes part-time.  I started therapy last year with a (mis)diagnosis of GAD and Bipolar II, and I developed several coping skills that have made doing all of this possible. I feel pleased with the accommodations I’ve created for myself to ease stress and the boundaries I’ve set to ensure I have capacity to enjoy things I love on top of supporting both of us. 

In the last six months, I have noticed that my partner calls upon his disability to explain away my concerns with our dynamic and some of his behaviors. An example would be conversations around housework and self-care. When I have asked him to start putting his dishes in the dishwasher or shower or change his clothes, he says, “Babe, I have a disability that prevents me from forming habits like that.” Or when I have asked him repeatedly to stop doing things to me like licking, pinching, or making mouth noises in my ear, which all feel like sensory nightmares to me, he brushes it off, saying, “I have a disability that literally makes me impulsive, I can’t stop it.” 

When I try to broach conversations around coping skills, therapy or resiliency skills, he ends the conversation by saying, “have you tried using a planner?” in a mocking tone. Medication has been a struggle for him as a result of some neurological side effects, so we don’t have that conversation much anymore. 

To me, having done a lot of work around accessibility and neurodiversity not just as a neurodiverse person but also as a professional and an educator, it reeks of internalized ableism. I find it incredibly insulting to hear him talk about himself like he has no control over himself or his life (I sense some fixed-mindset thinking in there, too). It’s also discouraging and makes me feel hopeless that it will always be like this. 

Because he doesn’t think he is able to help with housework because of his disability and because he continuously disrespects my personal space and body autonomy because of his disability, I find myself struggling to compensate with coping skills and even my medications when life gets stressful.I don’t get help from him around the house besides taking the trash out and he does not stop sending me into sensory overload at the end of a stressful day of work. 

I love him. There is so much to love which very much includes the hyperfixations, the wandering, interrupted conversations, and the way both of our impulsivities invite a lot of playfulness into our relationship. But, I know that playing caretaker when I myself also need support is not sustainable and will ultimately lead to burnout, even if I am medicated, in therapy, and actively practicing coping skills and accommodating myself. I want to be sensitive to his limits, but I sense that something else is at play here. 

How do I have a conversation around this? Is there something deeper going on?

difficulty dating while disabled ,"background: i'm 35 F disabled from a car accident with a severe brain injury and use a service dog. currently not working while i finish my workers comp case, but when i do find work again it will be very untraditional bc of my symptoms. 

i've honestly given up hope on meeting someone. i've been rejected from men i've met on dating apps when i talk with them and tell them with lines like ""i don't date disabled chicks"" etc. i also get met with the assumption im looking for something more than someone to share life with. i deleted all the dating apps bc i was so disheartened.

i haven't met anyone that's interested in dating someone that has needs. i have headaches, severe light and sound sensitivity, vestibular dysfunction (problems with balance and dizziness). some days are better than others and all the sudden i can have something trigger me, and im in bed for the rest of the day. but there are some days where i can do a decent amount. i've tried and interactions have left me so insecure ive stopped trying.

for example, i was dating a guy casually still getting to know each other and i invited him over for dinner. while preparing, i got a dizzy spell and had to lay down for a while til it passed. when he arrived, obviously i was behind and he made me feel so bad about not being ready at the time i gave. saying something like ""don't give a time if you can't be ready by then"" even though i was trying my best. this is just one example but there's been others.

the problem is , i am lonely and would like to meet a man that i could spend my life with. i dont want kids , never did but now i really dont, and thats another problem. it just feels like the odds are not in my favor.

any disabled people out there find success in dating? and how? currently, i feel too discouraged to get back on a dating app since i don't feel i have the same to offer as an abled person. have i just met assholes? i just don't know what to do.

Does anyone else feel guilt or shame about their sexual needs?,"I live in a country where sex work is legal and regulated but also attend a university in America. I started going to therapy when I came to America and have had several therapists try to convince me that having my sexual needs met from sex workers is the result of some unhealthy coping mechanism for some other underlying issue that they tell me that I’m responsible for figuring out as my therapy homework. I told every one of them the issue is probably just that I am human and that intimacy and sexual needs are normal. Every one of them told me I’m wrong and need to change my mindset if I want to get better. I don’t really understand if this is an American thing or a therapy thing. I should note that I haven’t tried to find any sex workers in America because I’m aware of the legality of it in America. I haven’t had this much shame about sex until I came to the America and started therapy around the same time. Also should note before anyone that goes after me that I don’t see sex workers in places known for human trafficking, prostituting minors, or other immoral things.

I saw someone else made a post recently about being rejected from a date because of their disability and read the comments so I at least feel a little less alone in knowing others have had those experiences as well. I’ve tried dating apps too. Didn’t go anywhere. No one outwardly rejected me for reason of my disability but sometimes I feel it too. After using dating apps I started getting a guilty feeling like as if I’ve been shortcutting intimacy and sexual needs when I’ve gone to sex workers. Like as if it’s something I need to have put hard work into and didn’t. I don’t know if this makes sense. The therapists have just told me in different ways to work on myself but I feel there’s only so much I can do that may not even help my feelings of lack of intimacy in America.",12,1ee0akr,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ee0akr/does_anyone_else_feel_guilt_or_shame_about_their/,12,1722145010.0

Get divorced to get full benefits?,"My husband and I have been on Medicaid for the past 4 years.

Could we get a divorce on paper so he could keep Medicaid? Would he be able to opt out of Medicare charges?

anyway, this will be my first time using these kinds of services and im very very very scared of basically people being awful to me, as i have read and heard of countless of horror stories from other disabled ppl using similar services.

I use a mobility aid regularly and have become frustrated because in the 3-4 years since I started using one I’m very much struggling to find something that suits my needs (a foldable crutch).

There’s a bit more to it but after a couple of years of searching I’m totally over waiting for someone to put out a product that works for my needs (and issues that I and other friends have talked about regarding mobility aids), but outside of the specs/requirements/potential design I’m totally lost as to where I can start.

"I can't convince my parents that it's wrong to treat people with disabilities as either ""aw you poor thing"" or unsung heroes who deserve a medal for just living and that disabled people don't like that.","So I wanna start by saying that I am not disabled, and I actually love my parents. They're great people. I love them, and I'm sorry, but they do have this one or two things where they have piss poor ideas and A TON of internalized discrimination and they just REFUSE to see it.

I had a pretty big fight with them at Christmas cause we were talking about the Olympics and they made a comment like ""oh my God, they deserve the gold medal just for being there 🥺"" and I was trying to explain that no, fuck no they don't. They're literally just athletes wishing for a fair competition to prove their worth in the sport they dedicated their lives to, how is that so hard to understand??? How would it be fair or kind to them to suggest that they must be ultimately unable to do that and they all just deserve to win for ""bEiNG tHeRe""? Their ""medal for being there"" IS being there and being able to say they made it to the Olympics, just like freaking everyone else. Why can't they see that it's discriminating to say that, since they would never say something like that for able bodied athletes?

They are sooo convinced that this freaking bunch of inspiration porn is actually the right way to treat disabled people, while every single interaction I've ever had with disabled people (a few actually, since I'm a med student really into activism and I'm SUPER interested in accessibility topics) and every disabled creator I've ever seen say says the polar opposite of that. Why can't they freaking listen to what disabled people have to say and respect that instead of thinking they somehow know the objective truth better that the people LIVING with it.

Sorry for the rant, it's just getting really frustrating.

My story.,"

Hello everyone. I am 24f and this is my story 

So i was born extremely premature at 24 weeks and had a brain hemorrhage at birth that affected my hearing and vision (i wear hearing aids).
I got glasses when i was around 6 years old, and growing up my eyes were bad enough that I was going to the eye dr every 6 months instead of every year. And each time i went, my prescription kept getting higher and higher.

Fast forward to me being 15-16 and trying to learn how to drive. I was completely terrified but i hated the fact that everyone else at school was getting their license and i wasn't. Also i was EXTREMELY stubborn and had the mindset of I will be just like everyone else and be as independent as possible. I did not want to acknowledge that i was disabled/different AT ALL. It took me 3 years to feel comfortable driving but i eventually got through it. My lifelong dream is to be a vet tech.

Skip a few years. I'm married, living away from parents and working at a pizza place. I really like my job. I gave up on my vet tech dream and am in community college for medical coding. But i start noticing something major. When i look through my right eye, i can't read words. Everything is blurry and shifted, like i'm trying to read underwater. I just brush it off as my vision getting worse like it usually does and try to ignore it.

 Honestly, i'm in survival mode. My marriage to an abusive man is failing (obviously) but again i'm too stubborn to give up on the marriage even in this situation. My mindset is well you always said one and only marriage now you have to deal with it. We are extremely poor. I'm smoking weed to cope with how shitty I feel my life is. I also get a ticket in April 2023 for ""following too close."" That will be relevant later.

November 2023. I finally have enough of the blurry vision in my right eye, it's getting extremely annoying to deal with. I call my dad and tell him the situation and he wants me to see my eye dr i had seen all my life because he trusts her. 2 hours away, where my parents live. He calls and makes the appointment. The soonest he can get is December 7, 2023, exactly a month away. I wait.

December 6 2023. My dad picks me up to take me to my mom's house (they're divorced). I tell my husband i'll see him tomorrow. Ha. Famous last words.

December 7 2023. My dad picks me up from my mom's and takes me to the eye appointment. We both are thinking that this will just be a normal prescription change, that we'll be in and out. Unbeknownst to me, the last few moments before my life forever changes. I tell the dr about the problems in my right eye. They put a letter on the screen. With my left eye I can tell it is a GIGANTIC A. But i still can't see it. Dr looks into my eye. She tells me to lean my chair back she'll be right back. This has never happened before. She comes back in with a magnifying glass the size of a baseball and me and my dad both realize something is definitely wrong.

She looks at my eye for literally 20 minutes, shining that bright light the whole time. Then she drops the bombshell. My retina is detached. She's calling a retina dr and seeing if he can get me in today. They keep asking me when the last time i had something to eat or drink was. I know that means surgery. I turn to my dad crying, saying i'm scared.

We go to the retina dr. It looks like a nursing home. I am the youngest patient there. We wait so long we think the dr has forgotten about us, then the nurse comes in. Says the dr is seeing everyone else first and me last because he knows he'll be with me a long time. Not a good sign. They keep asking me if i have been hit in the head recently. I lie and say no. (Husband).

The dr comes in. It's me, my mom, dad, and stepmom. He says that my retina has been detached for a very long time and is starting to die. That it's because of me being born premature, but no one ever told us this could happen. My mom is hysterical. I nicely ask her to calm down because I literally can't hear the dr speak over her. He says that the reattachment surgery will be very painful. And that i could possibly lose my actual eyeball. I need surgery right now, tonight. My dad walks out of the room and told me later that he completely broke down. I'm still sitting in the chair, completely terrified but smiling and saying that if i can get through being born, i can get through anything. Trying to keep everyone else calm.

We get to the hospital. I'm in the prep room. Everyone is there. Mom, stepdad, dad, stepmom. Everyone but the one person I want the most, the one I should be able to count on to be there no matter what. My husband. Deep down in my heart i know he's not coming. The dr says the surgery should be an hour and a half. My mom says later it was 3 hours. I get a scleral buckle and a gas bubble.

Fast forward a little. I finally tell my family about the abusive marriage. My dad asks how many times he slapped me in the face. I say probably 4 times in 5 years. He wonders if my husband is the reason for my eye problems.

Fast forward to now. I am divorced, and in a relationship with the sweetest most understanding gamer nerd in the world. I still have 2 semesters of college left, but i have also applied for disability. The retina dr says that i will never be able to read or drive with my right eye ever again. I have 2 cataract surgeries next month. I also have been diagnosed with macular degeneration and take eye vitamins every day. My bf and i have been talking about possibly moving in together down the road, and i have decided that if i get on disability, i want to be a foster mom for kittens. I have the best man and the greatest family. Life is good.",8,1edr2yo,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1edr2yo/my_story/,0,1722115563.0
Might finally be closer to an answer,"I’ve been searching for an answer of what’s wrong with me for a bit. I started having some symptoms around 2021 such as pain and muscle fatigue, but after being sent to rheumatology and them finding nothing the investigation kind of ended. Since then, and honestly mostly within the last year, my symptoms have significantly progressed to muscle spasms and cramps in my legs, falls and frequent stumbles/almost falls, tight muscles in my legs, urinary urgency, and the muscle fatigue and pain are still there but much worse. I can no longer walk independently and rely on forearm crutches (or a rollator at work) and I can’t walk for more than about 5-10mins without having to take a break and sit.  

I had a brain and cervical spine MRI in 2022 that came back normal except some mild degenerative signs in my cervical spine. And again, my symptoms have progressed a lot since then, but no recent doctor has wanted to redo my MRIs since my last ones were pretty recent. 

That was, until, the last neurologist I saw. I told her my symptoms and how they’ve progressed, and how quickly they’ve progressed in the last year (2023 I could pretty much walk without aids, and now, like I said, I can only walk 5-10minutes and I cannot walk without forearm crutches or rollator) and she ordered genetic testing for hereditary spastic paraplegia and a MRI of my brain and entire spine. 

I recently got these results back and the genetic test showed a VUS for autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia with an inconclusive ruling on if my specific variant is pathogenic, and my brain MRI showed a new finding of bilateral corticospinal tract hyperintensity at the level of the posterior limbs of the internal capsules. As far as I know, this basically means a part of my brain lit up on the MRI a bit more than it should have, and the area that lit up controls signals that are sent down my spine that are for movement function in my limbs. The results said this could be a possible sign of a motor neuron disease, such as spastic paraplegia. My back also showed various mild degenerative signs all along my spine at different points, but this wasn’t a surprise because back problems are very prevalent in my family. 

I just feel like I’m so close to maybe having an answer, but at the same time I’m so worried my doctor is going to say “no, none of this is clinically significant.” I have an appointment mid august to discuss my results and I’m just very nervous in all honesty. 

Camaraderie, support, advice, etc. is welcome by the way!

Looking for Advice.,"Hello! My name is Zack. Today I ask one simple question, r/Disability.

A couple months back a good friend of mine suffered a spinal injury. They were laid up in the hospital for several weeks, released only recently and now in a wheelchair. They made the trip home safely and are supported by local family. That, at least, is good.

I got to thinking recently, while talking with a mutual friend about the matter. Are there things to look out for? In theory the wheelchair situation is temporary but we don't know how long temporary is. It could be weeks or months of physical therapy.

So I'm thinking. What are some accessibility concerns that may arise that most people don't think about? Is there something that will be useful navigating their home or life in general now? Money's not really an issue, but please refrain from suggestions that the money could instead buy a new car.",3,1edvhjg,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1edvhjg/looking_for_advice/,6,1722128347.0
Pain While Walking,"I (24,F) have Cerebral Palsy although I am able bodied and can walk.

Are we destined for a denial 8 months after an initial application for visual impairment. ,"I'm going to try to sum this up as briefly as possible because I'd really like to hear from other people about their thoughts on it. 

My fiance is 53. He worked as a police officer for 23 years, until November 2023 when he had a repeat NAION in his left (and only seeing eye) that left him legally blind. The only clear sight he has left is from a tiny triangle of vision in the top left corner of his left eye. He had the first NAION in June 2023 in his right eye, leaving him with no clear field of vision in that one at all. He also has a medhx of a heart attack and quadruple bypass surgery three years ago and surgery to replace one of the cervival discs in his neck secondary to injuries he sustained in a vehicle accident a year before that. He has grade four kellgren osteoarthritis in his hip that will be replaced in October and grade 3 kellgren osteoarthritis in both knees. Along with the ""normal"" heart disease diagnoses, like hypertension and high cholesterol, he also suffers from depression, anxiety, and PTSD, which he has been treating for years with medication and therapy.

We submitted his initial application for SSDI in November 2023. The medical review began on January 4, 2024, and that's where we've been stuck. Within the first weeks they had received all of his medical records, and had been sent back the 83759202 completed forms they sent for us to fill out by hand. At the end of January, they sent him to one of their orthopedic doctors to be evaluated, which we were confused about because we were under the assumption that his blindness alone would automatically qualify him. We had only included all his other medical diagnoses because it said we had to. For months we heard nothing, and then in April they sent him to be evaluated by their own ophthalmologist (despite his medical records indicating the same diagnoses from all three of the different ophthalmologists (including one of the best neuro ophthalmologists on the east coast) that he went to before he ever applied for disability when he still had hope that he had been misdiagnosed and his vision could somehow be restored. Since then... NOTHING. His case worked had originally been really helpful. She'd even answered her office phone the two times we called earlier in the process with questions, but for the past couple months we have been unable to reach her and she has not returned our calls. His application went from 73%-89% (a percentage or two every couple days) over the last two weeks, but has since changed to show the ""step 3 of 5"" statement when we log in.

I tried my best to decipher his actual central visual field acuity from the HVF 30-2 sita fast exams he was given, but was unable to figure it out and it's not specifically stated. The neuro-ophthalmologist who has been primarily treating his NAIONs diagnosis from the results of his most recent visual field test only stated he had a ""paracentral island in his only seeing eye."" His notes further state ""left optic neuropathy, NAION in both eyes, concentric visual field constriction of both eyes, presbyopia, and poor prognosis."" 

There is just no way I can understand how they could NOT determine he meets the requirements for statutory blindness, but reading so many others' experiences, and realizing that they are past even their own ""expected timeline"" for a decision according to his account when we log in. Does this seem like a bad sign that they're taking so long? Or that they're not considering his visual impairment as severe enough for statutory blindness somehow?

Me (20M) and My Girlfriend (22F): Seeking Advice on Managing Severe Cognitive Issues and Financial Hardships While Navigating My First Job to Fund Medical Treatment,"

I really need some advice, and it's an emergency.

## Background

I'm a 20-year-old male student from a poor family. My single mother earns around ₹18,000 (about $215) a month. I have always been intelligent and sharp, knowing what I wanted to do with my life. Currently, I'm preparing for competitive exams and have no source of income. My mother's income barely gets us through the month, and it's a hard time for all of us.

## Mental Health Struggles

I have been dealing with depression since last year. Although I have recovered emotionally, my cognition and memory are at their worst. I can't remember what happened yesterday or even today. I can't recall a single name even if I read it five times. July has been the worst month, as I don't remember anything from it.

## Medical Challenges

My mother doesn't have enough money for a private or good doctor. The government doctor we saw doesn't acknowledge my problem and didn't provide me with suitable medicines. Making an appointment with them requires a two-day wait. My condition is worsening daily, so I had to turn to someone else—my girlfriend.

## Support from My Girlfriend

My girlfriend comes from a good financial background. She is the love of my life, and I want to do everything for her, but right now, my condition is so bad that sometimes I feel like I'll forget everything tomorrow and become brain-dead. In the past 2-3 months, I have seen many neurologists, psychiatrists, therapists, and dieticians. My mother paid for a few of them, but for the majority, my girlfriend paid for my sessions and medicines. I finally found a good psychiatrist who is helping me, though I'm still skeptical about whether I'll get better since my previous experiences with doctors were not good. I owe my girlfriend ₹12,284 (around $197). If my mother hears about this, she'd be very upset. I'm still seeing my psychiatrist and taking medicines, and I don't know when or if I'll get better. I can't keep asking my girlfriend for money, even though she says not to worry about it and to give her a small amount every month, which I am doing. But I feel the need to pay her back, so I decided to get a job to take matters into my own hands as I don't want to owe a very big amount that I wouldn't be able to pay her back.

## Job Struggles

I was nervous as this is my first job. Although I have worked in an NGO, this is my first salaried job. The salary is good for the job—₹13,000 (about $155). If I work there for 2-3 months, I'll be able to repay my girlfriend and have enough money for my treatment, hoping that I get better with that amount. However, I am still anxious about my brain and health. I went for the interview today, I forgot about the interview today when I woke up and it occurred to me 5-10 mins late that I had an interview today, and it was horrible. I got selected, though (it was mass recruitment, and everyone who came was hired). But I couldn't keep my head in one place, had multiple headaches, and zoned out multiple times. I couldn't comprehend what the recruiter was saying. I got so scared and anxious that I called my girlfriend and broke down in front of her. I just wanted to do the job to pay for my medical bills, but how can I do that if I forget what task I was assigned? I'll go there tomorrow and see how it goes. I told my mother about my job, she doesn't know why I'm doing that job and I don't want to burden her with the truth. She asked me not to do the job since it's very far and it's in a warehouse without any air conditioning and it's summer right now.

We all are unfortunate to be disabled and it is the worse thing that can happen to us. However this thread is meant to help us disabled people get deals, discounts, opportunities etc. Calm down. The helpful comments have just gotten me free/reduced cost parks, museums, transit, etc. If you can get past your anger about my imperfect wording then a lot of these comments can potentially help you!

Those living in USA, what perks have you found for being disabled? Besides receiving a monthly disability check from the government have you gotten any other “deals”?

Where I live I got a gym membership, stand up comedy classes, cbd supplements, healthcare for either heavily discounted or free. I’m looking for other things that I should take advantage of because being disabled sucks and I want to make the most of it!

I’d love to maybe get a good job that is very friendly to disabled people and/or a job training program and/or higher education like a masters degree or some continuing education classes that usually cost a lot of money.

I’d also love to get my rent reduced with maybe a disability program or housing lottery.

And there are probably tons of other things out there that I don’t know about. Like I’ll stumble upon random things, sometimes it’ll say “financial assistance” at the bottom of some random website I’m looking at and then there will be a section for disabled people along with other things like low income and military veterans.

Sleeping in,I feel terrible asking this. I am 47 years old. I have obviously been an adult for several decades. I have had no problem with being on time up until the last 1.5 years. I am currently going through some very stressful things. I am bouncing back and forth between not being able to wake up and not being able to sleep (I have anxiety and depression). I have a strict job and must be signed in and signed out strictly at a certain time. I must call off within 15 minutes of start time. I have overslept 3-4 times in the last year. The second time I went on depression medications which I think helped. I had to go off of them 2 weeks ago because I developed bald spots and I really did not want to live with that. I have overslept again. I have purchased alarms. I have purchased an app subscription that sets off an alarm and requires a barcode be scanned to shut it off. I live alone. I do not know how I am shutting off these alarms but I did it again and woke up 7 minutes too late. I have an appointment scheduled with my doctor to discuss the meds. I do not know how to fix this with 100% success. And my work is requiring 100% success. Can I request ADA accommodations with the call off time until I figure it out? I am currently on an intermittent absence because I'm losing it a little with the other stressors and I may return on reduced leave (all unpaid). I'm worried and I'm really not trying to be sloppy or a turd. I care about my job and my work. I just can't not suck lately. ,6,1ed9xb5,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ed9xb5/sleeping_in/,4,1722062219.0
My aunt accused me of faking my chronic illnesses/disabilities ,"Idk where to even start with this, it’s been a few days but I’m still just…idk if devastated is even the word? There’s so much nuance and little details I couldn’t begin to even add here. But I’ll try and condense it.

I’m employed for my family and need to work closely with my aunt, who has pretty severe trust issues but also major gossip issues. She doesn’t get along with anyone and is super quick to get mad if you say the wrong thing, or even if you didn’t say anything wrong in general and she interprets it that way. It feels like she’s always getting upset by something someone has done/said even if it’s not that bad; it feels like she’s always angry. I tried my hardest to be a support for her and her anxiety, and when working with her to try and be someone she could rely on. 
As time went on, the work is wearing on me badly. I’ve always been candid about my disabilities with her and we talked about chronic pain (what we both share) and I even spoke to her about my personal health issues and what it took to get diagnosed and she always seemed at least understanding. I tried my best not to call in but come in late on infusion days because calling in was next to impossible with how worried I was at making her mad at me. 

Anyways 

Fast forward to recently. Work has been excruciating. I’m autistic and have been chronically overwhelmed every single day, I was heavily su!cidal because of having to work in the amount of pain I was in, everything was too bright and too loud and too much all day all the time and I couldn’t even enjoy my 2 days off bc all I was doing was sleeping trying desperately to recover to do it all over again. I couldn’t use any mobility aids while at work bc it’s a hazard to what I have to do, I tried my hardest but genuinely feel as though my body was going to fall apart. A loved one of mine saw this and saw how desperate I was getting for reprieve and reached out to my aunt to try and talk to her about options, knowing she also had chronic pain. 
She took it completely the wrong way and blew up, like, exploded. Thinking my loved one was trying to “school” her on what chronic pain was, interpreting what they said as them saying I need to quit etc. she then goes to the group chat with me and a lot of her siblings to say she’s got those texts and is freaking out angry about them, then says: 

“I heard Giant doctor shops until they get the diagnosis they’re after”

(This broke my heart. I knew this comment came from my dad who has said this about me in the past when I was having to go to a lot of doctors to try and find out what was wrong with me and why I couldn’t really walk anymore suddenly)

And 
“I had honestly hoped they would blossom into this somehow and the illnesses would become less their focus” 

And 
“I was worried they would begin the “I am so sick, but I can get through it” behavior, but I also saw how they seemed to blossom” 

My dad has also used the “blossom” comment with me, which makes me hesitant that was her word choice. I know the reason people say that of me is because I’m medium support needs autistic and it’s hard for me to hold a job, so seeing me do one is “blossoming” I guess even though I’m literally falling apart at the seams so bad I’ll consider going ghost mode in the mornings just so I don’t have to go to work. 

The only person to even somewhat defend me was my other aunt, who did it in such a way that the aunt in question left the GC in frustration, so I’m grateful to my other aunt for that..I guess I’m just idk.

My stomach has been in knots ever since, I cried so hard that day I was hoarse and dehydrated I just don’t know what to do. I feel childish for avoiding talking to my father, but I know my aunt got those comments from him and even if years ago and even if he doesn’t think that way anymore (I think) he KNEW they came from him (I called him in tears asking if he had told her I doctor shop and he matter of factly said “yes…years ago” and then I hung up after I cried more) we haven’t spoken since that phone call. 
Am I dumb for wanting an apology? He wants to treat it like things are fine and back to normal but knowing he spoke about me that way and how it eventually came back to hurt ME and not him, and how he didn’t defend me and how he didn’t even try to correct the gossip…it makes me feel so…idk I guess betrayed. 

And as for my aunt, I feel dread if I have to see her again. I’m going to try and avoid her as best I can, she texted me a few days later trying to get information but I just screenshotted it and sent it to the GC and didn’t reply. I don’t think I want to speak to her ever again. This whole time. 
This WHOLE TIME. Like, I didn’t think she liked me, I knew she probably thought I was weird and annoying but oh my god I feel so stupid I ever shared personal information about myself or was vulnerable with her in any way. I was trying to support her, and be someone she could trust because she’s so hateful and angry and doesn’t trust anyone. She seemed to think we were a lot alike and she would vent to me often, say inappropriate weird things and I wouldn’t comment on it, I was always a passive person she could vent at and I tried so hard to be what I thought she needed. 
I shared how awful it was for me to try and be diagnosed and how many doctors I went to and how some things are still unresolved. This whole time she thought I was a fake. I just. I’m gonna cry just typing it. Some of it is stuff I couldn’t even fake if I tried, like a rare blood disease. 

I just don’t know what even compelled her to reply that way. My loved one was just like “hey I’m really concerned about giant’s health” and she flew off the handle to accuse me of something like that, in a group chat, to my extended family members. 

Sorry for the long vent I just, idk, I’m used to ableism but this just hurt so bad. The layers to it hurt. The fact that it was gossip, that it was what my dad said (even if a year ago, I guess that somehow stuck in her head), how she got to know me for months and didn’t even think to challenge that idea of me. 

I feel sort of lost. I don’t know what to do. It’s too late for me to reply, all I said was “I’ve never done that.” But she didn’t respond, ignored it and just continued talking to her sister. I thankfully have time off work now to try and recover but this whole thing makes me seriously wonder if I should even return. I need the money desperately, I don’t want to quit, but at the same time it’s destroying me. I wish someone had defended me more or I wish in the moment I had at least asked “why would you say that about me” something :(

Sorry I just needed to vent. It’s been a lot..

Looking for Advice,"Last year my father (61 Years old) fell and had a cut he left untreated. This turned into sepsis and put him into the hospital from December until May of this year. It was compounded by 3 years of not taking care of his diabetes and making his mobility poor at best. During this time, he started on short term disability from his office job, which then turned into long term disability as the months passed by. 

My dad lives on his own in Tennessee with no family or friends (outside of his work friends) and over 12-hour drive from my sister and I in Pennsylvania, and over 8 hours from his 5 brothers in various southern states like Georgia. He has large amounts of debt, rents a furnished home by the week, and owns no vehicle.

Upon release he was eager to get back to work even with his still limited walking capabilities. I had ordered him a walker to replace his less-than-ideal walker sent home from the hospital to assist with his mobility. He had also had a small fall leading to a cut on his forehead with the hospital walker. He then got in touch with the company he was employed with and began the process of trying to be able to work from home. They informed him they required him to report to the office instead and that he would need a return to work note from his doctor clearing him for work. 

This began the long process of trying to get him into a doctor for assessment and sign off. Once we were finally able to get him the documents his HR department requested. He was informed immediately that his disability checks were done. However, his HR then requested he provide additional doctors notes outlining his capabilities at work. Which led to more weeks of unpaid struggle to achieve. 

He finally had all the requested paperwork and was cleared to return to work. He was excited and ready to leave the house. During his first week back to work he was trying to carry his lunch from the break room back to his desk, but only having one hand on his walker led to him having a fall in the hallway. He hit his shoulder and head into the drywall but was okay (at least to his report to me). Another worker saw his fall in the office hallway and helped him back up and got him to the company nurse. She sent him home and was told to stay home while HR investigated. 

Yesterday his HR department informed him he was being put back on leave of absence and his position would be filled. They told him if he went back to the doctor to get a fitness of duty test outlining his need for a walker he could apply for other, lesser paying positions that I don't honestly believe even exist at the company.

So he is currently receiving no pay, no disability pay, and is desperate for help. Will likely be limited mobility for the remainder of his life. 

My wife and I rent, and our lease is very strict about having more than 2 people living in the house. My sister has a small home with 2 bedroom and young children. So we are hoping that we can find someplace extremely cheap for him to rent near us or that one of his brothers (not on the best of terms with each other) would take him in. 

I'm writing this in hopes that anyone with advice or insight into these types of disability situations could shed light on any options I may not be aware of. As his rental is weekly and he's now making no money its putting pressure on us to figure out options quickly.

Eyepatches to go under glasses?,"Hi I have a issue with my left eye and while it's not explicitly a disability I didn't know where else to ask this.

I am effectively blind in my left eye I only see enough for it to be an annoyance and look bad. It effectively extends my peripheral vision a further 80ish degrees left. I also have a insane drift in my left eye. So my left eye is constantly looking 45ish degrees further left. 

This drift is really disruptive. Whenever I'm at work on the computer, watching tv, gaming my left eye is constantly looking offscreen. When i go cinema I have to sit on the Far left or get a weird almost double image. Whenever travelling & I'm looking forward and my left eye is looking out the side window. Whenever I  walk & someone or something enters my left eyes fov I instantly turn my head because I can't tell what it was. 

The drift wasn't always that bad but it's been getting steadily worse across the years. & frankly it has been impacting my self-confidence. 

I can't afford the surgery to have the drift fixed & frankly i don't even know if the surgery is an option due to my epilepsy. So I thought about eye patches to block out the vision and it I hope it looks less bad. But most eye patches I've found suck for glasses users I was wondering if anyone found so good ones.

Walking a dog while disabled ,"Hi ! 
So I adopted a dog a few months ago after my childhood dog Tangka passed away. She's an elderly, 10 yo small dog that we named Gaia. Although she has an unknown past and is already pretty old, she's so energetic and happy and having her here is an absolute bliss. She's so cute and an absolute sweetheart. 

But there is a problem, walking her is so painful, and I have trouble going outside at all. I have really debilitating migraines, chronic pain and sensory issues, so being outside for a walk can be an absolute nightmare. Walking for a long time can worsen my headaches, and like most dogs she also likes to bark a lot, which adds to it and can induce sensory overload. 

I live with my mother who can also walk her, but she also has some troubles doing so.
I really wand Gaia to have the best life possible, but being a pet owner just in general can be so difficult. I haven't got much time to get to know my disabilities since I was diagnosed recently, so I'd really appreciate it if you could give me some advice.

Am I Being Dramatic About A Situation?,"I have a hair stylist and she is abled bodied. Her business is a private business and she says she doesn’t have to follow the ADA (which she totally DOES have to follow the ADA). Yesterday when getting my hair done she had told me she thinks i’m “Using resources that i don’t need” for example, she called my very much task trained service dog an emotional support animal. I’m autistic, have dysautonomia, and can’t bend down all the time because of a spinal cord injury. That’s what the dog helps me with. I also need a wheelchair because it’s dangerous for me to walk around because of some of my health issues including the ones in this post listed. She genuinely thinks i’m abusing resources, But because i’m not “disabled” enough (i’m assuming she doesn’t think i am because i’m “too young” and she can’t see my disabilities she doesn’t take it seriously). I’ve grown very close with this stylist and i’m not sure if i’m overreacting if i want a new person and go to a new business. She says i’m being “coddled” because i use resources and because my mom gets me medical attention (i’m 20 and unable to live on my own and drive right now because of medical problems). Am I being dramatic because i kinda want to find a new hair stylist?

How to get pets out of my wheelchair path? ♿️🐈‍⬛,"I’m mostly bedbound with severe me/cfs. I use a manual wheelchair to get to the bathroom and kitchen a few times a day. It takes all my limited energy just sitting up and rolling down the hall to do those things.

Enter my two cats 🐈‍⬛ 🐈 

I love them and I know they miss me and want more of my attention. But when I desperately need to get back to bed and they’re blocking my path to roll there, I literally can’t handle it. 

I ask them to move. I slowly roll towards them. I nudge them with my feet. I repeat. But they keep sitting or laying in the way. 

My overly sensitive fuse is burned out and I get angry and loud. Then I often have to bend over, physically pick them up and move them. Sometimes more than once. All of this is causing my health to deteriorate further.

How are other people with wheelchairs dealing with pets blocking their path?

Looking for good looking / non-medical-looking mobility aids,"Hi Reddit! 

I am trying to look at a variety of mobility aids for a family member and I can’t seem to find anything that looks really nice? 

I completely understand that these devices need to be medical grade, but I often find these very bulky looking. My family member is totally new to this, and has been having trouble to accept using mobility aids for that very reason. 

Does anyone know anywhere that sells good-looking ones? 

Edit: we’re quite new to this, and not even sure what mobility aids will be required. At the moment we’re looking at hand rails for the house, bathroom rails and a rail for the toilet, and things like a shower seat. We also may need to look at zimmer frames. 

My question is: where do you go to look for these things? Ideally ones that are a little more subtle looking/aesthetic and less medical looking (again, not 100% sure what I’m looking for!)

What actually happens when you file a complaint against a home health care agency?,"What exactly does APD do when you file the complaint against the agency? Does it actually have any kind of meaningful repercussion or impact that prevents the company or company owners or whoever from continuing to mistreat clients?

Or is it essentially just a useless blemish on their record? 

I had to file a complaint against the owner of the agency that provides my In-Home Care because she was being extremely verbally abusive. Was threatening me. Was just talking about me in a way that's very vulgar. 

But now my caregiver is like...offended that I reported the agency even though I did my best to keep the caregiver's name out of it and to make sure to talk very highly of the caregiver whenever her name was brought up. 

I don't trust either of them now. Especially since the caregiver is now trying to gaslight me to protect herself. Trying to claim like the company owner never threatened me, when I know for a fact that she did. The caregiver's trying to play dumb about the threats now. But that's whatever. If that's what she wants to do, I can't stop her. 

What's really bothering me is that she tried to gaslight me into believing that I was lying to APD about the threats that the company owner was making against me.",5,1ecesza,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ecesza/what_actually_happens_when_you_file_a_complaint/,2,1721966512.0
How can I take care of myself and my child?,"I'm currently disabled from fibromyalgia and long covid.  My doctor recommends that I get lots of rest, don't over exert myself, and do my best to use what energy and ability I have to live healthy.  My husband says he understands, but he says his work prevents him from doing anything around the house, much less take care of our young child.

So I've been pushing through.  Sacrificing my wellbeing to keep our household afloat.  I knew he was playing computer games when he said he was working overtime, but I just count it towards his work as a destress portion.

It's come to my attention that he is playing computer games almost everyday, and he's not only been playing in the evening and weekends, he's been playing during work hours.

In the last two weeks he's clocked in over 85 hours of game time.  Today he's not even hiding it anymore.  I can hear him talking on discord while playing during the day.

My health is failing because I'm not getting the rest and care I need.  Our child is being neglected by him.  The little interaction they have with each other tend to be negative. I could speak up about it, but from past experience I know he will just get furious, deny he did anything wrong, and then turn it around on me when I point out the evidence and he can't deny it anymore.  I didn't even say anything and he got mad at me when I accidently walked in on him playing computer games when he should have been working.

I've been living like a single mother with a disability.  We both have income, but sometimes I wonder if it's any different than being on my own income only since he is controlling and spending it secretly on the side.  The difference is my income is from disability benefits and that's as stable as my condition, not very stable.

I guess I'd like to ask people who have a disability, how are you managing your wellbeing if you have no help and also have a young child.  Are there any affordable services that can help?  Do you have techniques or ideas on how to survive the situation?",15,1ec5j7e,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ec5j7e/how_can_i_take_care_of_myself_and_my_child/,5,1721940365.0
How can I stop being resentful towards my mother for her disability?,"My mom has a chronic pain condition from a spinal cord injury. She can walk and stand for a short period of time. She doesn’t leave the house except to get groceries because of her pain. 
My father passed away, (they weren’t together) and he was the only person who could get me out of the house. My mom said I couldn’t go to driver’s ed until I didn’t have any D’s or lower on my report card. I was able to get my grades up and pay for it, (and got a car) but I can’t get my license if I’m only driving once every two weeks. 
I feel so trapped. She is constantly complaining even driving me to work. I don’t have any connections anymore. I don’t have a nice family, and have been too depressed to care to make/keep up with friends. I want to experience life. I want to go places and do things and not be in my head all day. I want to be normal. My social skills have declined so bad since COVID (she’s immunocompromised and was extremely paranoid and obsessive about it for years, even after my whole family got vaccinated and after the cases dropped to nearly none) I don’t feel like I have the tools to be successful because I have been so sheltered. Not leaving the house has made my depression worse, especially over the summer. There is public transportation in my town, but it would take me hours to even get to a bus stop. I feel so bad for feeling resentful and so bad that I don’t even feel a connection towards my mother in the first place. I don’t feel resentful for us living in poverty for so long because she can’t work, I don’t feel resentful that I have to help her or listen to her complaints or that she doesn’t care to do the things she is capable of doing either. I don’t know why this is the thing I’m resentful of. 

Edit: I just wanted some help. I didn’t want to have to justify a single comment I made, knowing damn well how she spent all of our money on canned goods, talked about it every single day, and kept me home for years even though we were all vaccinated, instilled crippling fear into me and my brother, and wore masks and she made me wear masks long after everyone had stopped. It’s not like I don’t believe in COVID, or don’t know how it works, don’t know it’s not over, or even don’t understand how life-threatening it is for immunocompromised people. Her fear was warranted, but it was an unhealthy obsession based on the amount of her life is dedicated to it vs. her chances of getting it. I was scared of being the “bad guy,” so I tried explaining these things, but some of you I cannot reason with. You’re missing the point entirely. I need help on one issue, but you are latching on to one comment I made and becoming offended. I have nowhere else to post this to find people with experience in disability. I value your input, but you are not understanding the gravity of her obsession.",0,1ed4hlp,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ed4hlp/how_can_i_stop_being_resentful_towards_my_mother/,42,1722043385.0
My mom does not understand im disabled,"I have been asking my mom for mobility aids and she says no bc my doctor has not explicitly stated to get them. He also said i need to be sweating everyday NOT EVEN WALKING JUST SWEATING and she points to that as him saying i dont need them.

She asked about them today and he said to focus on electrolytes and medicine YES THATS GOOD BUT ALSO I CANT MOVE. I can barely walk with migraines and walking to long is a trigger. Not even walking. Walking for too long. She tells me i have to improve my cardiovascular health yeah that will help me but it will not completely mitigate my fatigue and pain. I AM DISABLED NOT LAZY.

She keeps telling me to workout and what my plan is to improve my cardiovascular health mom i have MIGRAINES.

Sorry this is a very long winded rant. Uhhh of you have advice how to help explain this to her much appreciated 

Edit: hi i wrote this very frustrated and not expecting very many repsonses lol, let me explain some context

1. My mom for a long time didnt want to acknowledge my disability. Ive been grappilng with this for around 3 years meow and i have started calling it a disability and saying im disabled. She didnt like this at first and felt like it was too extreme of a label. 
Once when we were taking a walk i was explaining i cant do it with a migraine and i probably shouldnt have been doing it that day either (postdrome from a 3 day migraine) and she said “well are you disabled in the legs?” I immediately got a rebound migraine.

2. Yes, i do have a neurologist and i do take both preventative daily meds and i have sumatriptan and one for nausea. Seemed to be a very common comment lol

3. My mom has started a new diet and is constantly pointing out whats health, whether something has fiber, if a meal is balanced, that i should have protein, etc. she also started to tell me i needed to work out more because i should improve my cardiovascular health. All of this isnt wrong but shes started to equate this to relieving my migraines. Also, when i had a consistent sleep schedule (aka sleeping very early bc im an early bird) she told me i had to push it back but when i asked why she couldnt give me a reason.

Finding an Accessible Home Post-Breakup – Need Tips and Solace,"Hey everyone,

I recently went through a breakup after several years with my partner, and it’s thrown my life a bit out of balance. We used to split household chores, like laundry and yard work. The laundry room is in the basement, so my partner always took care of that. They’re moving out soon, and while I can manage laundry a few times on my own, it’s not a sustainable solution for me.

When we moved in together, my physical disability was not as advanced. I had a lot more balance and strength in my lower limbs, but now I don’t, which makes it difficult to go downstairs to do laundry. I’m struggling with the confusion and sadness from the breakup, and on top of that, having to think about living accommodations that I’m not quite ready for feels overwhelming.

In my area, everything is expensive, but you get more bang for your buck if you buy a house. You get more space, anyway. Buying a condominium unit would mean that I have the exterior taken care of, so I wouldn’t need to worry about that. I know there are some condominium houses that take care of the outsides, but I’m not sure if I need the extra space of a house when living alone. Maybe I’m just scared of moving on and really getting a fully accessible place.

I don’t think I’m scared of my disability anymore—I’ve been dealing with it for a long time—but I guess I’m hesitant because moving into a more accessible place would just make my life easier. At the same time, I want to keep trying to move around and use a walker as long as I can before switching to a wheelchair full time, which I will do when I need to.

I’m considering selling our house and buying a new place. Ideally, I’d prefer not to move into an apartment or condo, but I think it might be the best option for the long term. I’m having trouble finding accessible options in my area. Most listings only mention an accessible entryway, but I need more than that.

I’m also looking for a realtor who understands accessibility needs, but I haven’t found any specialists yet. Does anyone have tips on finding accessible housing or a knowledgeable realtor? Any advice or solace would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, everyone.",4,1ecbysk,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ecbysk/finding_an_accessible_home_postbreakup_need_tips/,2,1721957630.0

Just wondering about help I could get for school,"I’m bad at these types of things but mostly just looking for advice, I am both physically and mentally disabled, on the mental side its ASD, ADHD, getting tested for I think its called something like disorder of written expression very soon, getting tested for narcolepsy soon, and various other things, and on the Physical side its some junk with one of my lower legs plus foot (bone weird after break, in a brace currently with more junk upcoming), Fibromyalgia, plus maybe other things they are being annoying about testing about (fibro doesnt fit the whole bill, all you gotta know is very bad regular pain, brain fog, stomach issues, migraines, extreme fatigue, all that junk)
 Well so I’m about to go into my “final” year of high school and I know from especially last year (when I got my first major punch in the face from fibro) that I won’t physically be able to complete all my course work in time, the reason I say final like how I did is because I have accepted since last year that unless jesus himself were to walk down and do something I am not graduating in time, so that brings me to what I want to do, make the most of it.

I am already not gonna pass on time so why dont I make the most of that crap and do half the junk this year and the rest next year, it would 
1. allow me to reduce the strain on myself (my body has very strict limits that even just something as simple as writing for 5 minutes or typing for 40 surpasses, ive tried my best to increase them but with little progress so far) 
and 2. be able to let me get actual good grades in the classes I will have, i barely squeeked by in the ones I didnt realize i had to give up last year and this would give me more a chance to focus.

I have even discussed this with both parents and some doctors (main ones I need to get to are the pain doctors) and they all agree this would be best but the issue is, we know that no matter what we do the school is gonna be stubborn about it, do any of you have any advice to help make it happen? My therapist has straight up told me to go over which classes to take this year with her once i get my schedule and once we decide to just flat out ignore the rest while we are getting it sorted, this is happening weather the school wants it or not, but still some advice on how to get any actual support from the school would be nice.

 I’m late to the James Somerton train but his view on AIDS makes me mad.,"


I'm late to the James Somerton train but his view on AIDS makes me mad.

For context for those of you here which are not terminally online. James Somerton was a popular gay YouTuber whose popularity dropped like a rock when fellow YouTuber HBomberguy made a video on plagiarism exposing him and other YouTubers.

Somerton has been through a lot of shit and I don't want to add more onto it but his videos on AIDs made me mad. I relate to his plagiarism reasons even if I don't approve.



his base assumption was that all the radical gays died of AIDS leaving the ""boring ones"".



it ignores how AIDS was transmitted yes through sex and needles but also through tainted blood transfusions. which killed and infected thousands of people with Hemophilia and other conditions that require blood transfusion regardless of political views, sexuality, and gender.



Ryan White was a icon of AIDs victims because he was an all-American suburban boy who got AIDs from a blood transfusion.



it also suggests that radicalism is tied to someone's sexual behavior. when many radical leftists did not have sex or did drugs for whatever reason.

giving his other acts of acephobia it seems to be a common trend with Somerton who thinks abstaining from sex makes you a square.

Which is funny as he is one of the so called “boring gays”.

There is a grain of truth in that poorer people tend to have more radical politics and thanks to lack of resources they tend to die more. But it’s not a AIDS thing.

In general while the AIDS epidemic impact on the queer community is discussed the impact it had on the disabled community among people who required regular blood transfusions like Hemophilics is ignored expect for certain cases like Ryan White.",22,1ebrn7t,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ebrn7t/im_late_to_the_james_somerton_train_but_his_view/,2,1721903815.0
Did you ever get gig that showed how really weak you are?,"I know we all have different experiences, but I wanted to ask if you've ever gotten a really good gig, or job, but were later forced to quit because you realized you weren't up to it. 

As a paraplegic with limited education from a third-world country, online gigs are usually all I have to make a living. Apart from my blog, which isn't as successful as it was at the start, I recently landed a good-paying gig as a chat agent for a company. I was successfully accepted into the role. 

I thought this was it – I'd finally found a job I could really do and actually stop worrying about not being able to pay for everything that's important to me. But that wasn't really the case after four days of working. The job had eight-hour shifts plus a 30-minute lunch break, and I was always exhausted after each shift, feeling unusual pain all over my body. After four days of working, I finally quit because my body really couldn't take it. This has really depressed me as it showed how much weaker I am than I thought.

And the pain of giving up this opportunity came immediately after I received payment for the four days I had worked. It was $38 (which is great money in my country), as it helped me pay for my internet for at least two more months and some groceries. That makes it even more frustrating for losing the opportunity. It was more than I had earned in ad revenue for my blog in three months. I felt really angry that I lost such a great opportunity that was going to change my life, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since.

I know that our worth is not how much I work. I'm a radical leftist who believes everyone deserves a safe and happy life.

My Dad refuses to help me find a group home for my adult autistic brother. ,"Hello reddit. I am in a situation where I am not sure what to do, or what could happen to me for the future.

To start, I (27F) have an older autistic brother (31M) who lives with my dad (55) and my grandma(81) takes care of him part time. My mom passed away in 2022 so she is not in the picture. The issue is, my dad absolutely refuses to help me look for a group home for my brother after he dies, or any type of assisted living at all. My brother can't work or drive and he basically acts like a child. He's always home and always on his computer doing nothing. He can handle basic hygiene but he can't really cook for himself. To sum it up he can't live alone at all. My dad has been abusive in the past physically, he constantly talks down to me, and he has been a heroin addict since like the mid 2000's. He is not fit to be a parent. My grandma is 81 and my grandpa just passed away in June, and this was kind of a wake up call to me to start planning for my brother. I wrote my dad a huge letter stating how I will not he caring for my brother and he has to find other plans. I showed him a great assisted living place by me and I told him his case worker can help him find housing for my brother. He told me to fuck off and to not contact him and to stay out of this. What will happen if no plan is set and my other family dies? I don't trust my dad to do anything. He says he has other plans but refuses to tell me. My brother currently receives SSI and he had medicaid and a case worker which is good news, and he is diagnosed with autism as well so it is on record. I just am so scared of them dying and them having absolutely nothing set up for my brother. My family lives in poverty and they don't have any money saved up. Not sure if this information helps but I am located in Ohio. How can I force my dad to start making plans? Should I call adult protective services or report this to his case worker? Will he be forced on me if they die? Will I have to take him in or will the state make him a ward of the state and find him placement? Any advice will help me please. I want to start taking action now

Must be able to drive :/,"I’m American living in the south so this question won’t apply to everyone, but why on earth is it legal for jobs that do not involve driving as part of your duties to require that you are capable of driving and own a car?

but why on earth do I need a drivers license and a working car to be able to work a medsurg nursing job that doesn’t involve driving as far as I can tell from the description and duties listed?? 

This isn’t the first time I’ve seen it and it feels unfair. My husband reliably drives me where I need to go, it’s not like not being able to drive means I don’t have reliable transportation. And what about the people that can drive but don’t own a car?? I just don’t get why that’s an okay standard to throw in there.

how do i tell my parents i need mobility aids?,"i (15, ftm) experience on and off pain in my back, legs, and ankles. i’ve been to an orthopedic doctor and she said the structure of my feet is fine, but i can bend them in ways she’s never seen. ive talked with my primary care doctor about the pain and she just says i need to exercise more often. my body is in pain after walking short distances, and im worried because im starting at a new, larger school this September.

I go to a summer camp every summer, and a lot of people there struggle with cronic pain and illness. when i’ve expressed my struggles, they suggested talking to my parents about possibly getting a cane and some braces for my legs. my question is how do i approach the situation?

i think my mom will be more supportive of my needs, but will want me to try to stick it out. i don’t want to force myself to do things that i physically cannot do without pain. my dad on the other hand will think i’m lying for attention and because im young im healthy. i just want to be able to move like my peers do. 

im in marching band at my high school, and im so tired after 1-3 reps of movement. i know something is wrong, but none of the adults in my life believe me. i don’t want to have to take advil every night because im sore anymore. i can’t walk very long without needing to sit or lean on something, and my feet get very tired after a short time of standing.

I am a disabled senior with 3 cats,"Hi. I am a disabled 61 year old senior and have til the end of the month to vacate my unit of 10 years. 

A bit of my backstory. I had a roomie that lost her job and hadn’t paid rent since November of last year. I was really struggling after she left, but was making my bills - barely. I applied for 2 different assistance programs because I ended up bouncing April’s rent check. I tried to work with my landlord by paying my current month plus an additional $500 a month til I would be paid in full. It would have taken me current 4+months to get. But, my landlord refused all payments - he wanted all or vacate premises. Now I’m 6 months past due with no where to turn. My 3 cats and I will be homeless at the end of this month and I am so scared. Unfortunately I was born and raised in So Cal, which is NOT the cheapest place to live. I have zero monies for a security deposit and who is going to rent to me when I owe my current landlord approx $7,000. Then, just to make things more interesting in my boring life, I was (uninsured) frauded which took all of my savings. I’m usually a very positive glass half full type person, but I’m really struggling. I know there are people out there with way worse problems than I currently have, but I feel like there’s no where to turn.

Stay away from Vitality Medical,"Warning, long post incoming, but I believe others here should know.



Wow, what a downturn Vitality Medical has taken, they used to be the best in the business, they are the complete opposite of that today. I have given them several raving reviews over the years, from countless purchases, including one for this very, $220, order back in April, and at the time I was happy to do so. One of the biggest kickers in this ordeal, is that in the beginning, my biggest concern was that things work out fairly for VM too, I wasn't trying to rip them off, or get something for free.

I have been disabled since 2016, and I have been using Vitality Medical for most of my supplies, anything that wasn't covered under Medicare for years now. Part of my disability requires my usage of urinary catheter bags, 24x7. Typically, these bags need to be changed out usually twice per month. I ordered a case of 20, back in April, $130, at least 10 months worth. These bags are sealed in plastic bags, so that they remain clean and sterile, and covered in an additional protective layer of white medical paper, meaning you cannot see the urinary bag inside. The line on the very first bag I took out of the case had a kink in it. The silicone lines on these bags are soft and semi-pliable, meaning when you get a kink in the line, it will no longer work.

I opened another bag, and it was fine, so I used that one. Sometimes you get an occasional bad bag out of the packaging, so I didn't think anything about it. I am not going to say anything over a single bad bag, I figure that's the cost of doing business. Well, fast forward to this month, I go to change my bag again, open the packaging, and a second bag with a kinked line. I figured that makes two out of three that I have opened from this case, that does not bode well for the remaining 18, I should contact Vitality Medical, surely they will help fix this.

When I contact them, I told the lady I spoke with, that I can't open all of the bags to see how many are damaged, as they are sealed and sterile, and that I'd be happy to keep track of the bags in this case, taking pictures and documenting each bad bag, if needed, so that they could just replace the number of bad bags. Clearly, with the first two out of three being bad, there is going to be more, I just hope it isn't too many, because it would make things even more difficult than they already are. I am a very honest person, I have never stolen anything in my life, I certainly would not try to rip off a company that I previously thought so highly of, I am not just trying to get something for free, though most here will know that being on disability, I need for the things that I do purchase to not be ruined out of the box, especially in today's financial environment.

I just heard back from an Edmar Cabrillos, that they would not be accepting a return on my order, as it is past the 30 days return window. In years past, Vitality Medical's staff were always very helpful, caring, and knowledgeable, it is clear that they are no longer any of those things. They now have people with no clue as to how any of the things their company sells are used, if they did, they would understand that it would literally be impossible for me to know how many bad bags I had out of that case in the first 30 days, unless, of course, I opened all of them, thus rendering even the good bags useless as well due to the sterile seal being broken. Not to mention it is literally impossible, as I mentioned, to see inside of the packaging containing the bags, due to the white paper covering each bag.

This premise is entirely untenable, as I am always ordering my supplies in volume, the last thing I ever want is to run out of supplies, so I order many months worth at a time. All of my supplies are always sealed, and sterile, meaning I cannot view the items inside the packaging, and if I open them, they are no longer sterile.

So, now I am left with a case of bags, that I have no idea just how many of them are good, but Vitality Medical is refusing to do anything about the ones that we know are bad. Because they have people making decisions on these things, who have no clue what they are actually deciding. Either that, or they are just going to say no to any order past the 30 day mark, including orders like mine, where it would be impossible to know if the item you bought from them, was actually damaged, or not. If it is, Vitality says, ""Oh, well, you'll just have to eat that, Mr Customer"", in this case, I am supposed to eat $130.

Vitality has gone from having knowledgeable, helpful, and caring staff, to the exact opposite of their former status in the industry, in a very short amount of time. I am posting this, as I believe our community must look out for each other, in order for others to not be financially hurt by a situation like this, by a company who, it is quite clear, could care less about you. I have no doubt our community likely makes up 90%+ of Vitality Medical's business, and if they are doing this to me, they are surely going to do it to others, either now or in the future. We have to look out for one another, because companies like Vitality Medical clearly are not going to.

Stay far away from Vitality Medical folks, especially those with lingering medical issues that require regular maintenance, they will refuse to stand behind the products they sell you, and will demand the impossible from your side.",5,1ez0x7u,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ez0x7u/stay_away_from_vitality_medical/,0,1724378018.0

Vision accessibility at Edinburgh Fringe Festival,"Hi,

I'm sighted.  I'm preparing a one-person show for next August.  My show involves me talking about a slideshow, and occasionally breaking into song.  The venue will probably seat fewer than 40 guests. 

I figured I would offer an FM signal with a little more info about the slides than I'm likely to say on mic.  It would also describe my costume and the unusual musical instruments I'm using.  The FM audio feed would be pre-recorded for each slide, and I wouldn't hear it while performing.  I pictured someone with limited vision wearing a headset on one ear only, so they could also hear the room well.  I could include the live sound in the broadcast but it's a low budget show and I doubt I'd be giving a super high-quality mix.  

Are blind people as likely as anyone else to travel with a headset?  How about an FM receiving device?  I have a couple old cell phones that receive FM when a headphone wire is hooked up.  I could loan those out. 

Would it make more sense for me to just ask at the beginning of every show how many blind people are in the audience, and just be prepared to insert more verbose explanations into my presentation?  I could warn the venue and the act following me of that plan, and I'd dare them to complain about me running a bit long to make such an accommodation.  The festival has a bad enough reputation about accessibility as it is. 

Thanks for any help and advice,

What is considered “disabled enough” for an IEP? Or any disability services.,"I graduated from HS last year and looking back, there are some things that are confusing. Especially when it came to IEPs.

For reference, I’m diagnosed with two different developmental disabilities and several mental illnesses. This in itself isn’t a reason to qualify but all together, I was unable to function at school.

I couldn’t ride the bus, be in the hallways, or in class without significant issues. It’s hard to explain exactly what the problems were. My grades were failing and I was unable to do classes because I was in too much distress to pay attention. (In the end, I ended up being unable to attend in-person school & staying home with a caregiver/doing online classes.)

The school would not accept diagnosis from outside of the school district. So they did their own testing. When the testing concluded, each time they determined there was no reason I would need an IEP as I didn’t fit the disability criteria. My family tried every year to get me an IEP, but the same result came every time. All the way through middle and high school.

I’m wondering if maybe I wasn’t disabled enough. I have level 1 autism which is often considered too high functioning for aid. And mental illness is just considered “other” rather than disability. 

If I wasn’t disabled enough for an IEP, then I wouldn’t be disabled enough for accommodations (if I went to college) or for government aid. Which is concerning because I cannot work at all, I can barely leave my home. I have to have family with me to go to even doctor’s appointments. I am medicated and in various different therapies, I have been for a long time. But I’m still unable to function properly, yet I’m not considered disabled?

I don’t know. Back to an IEP, what do you have to be? Do you have to be blind, deaf, or have an intellectual disability to have one? Do you have to have more severe autism? What is considered “disabled enough” for an IEP or any disability services?",6,1eysoqp,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eysoqp/what_is_considered_disabled_enough_for_an_iep_or/,6,1724356056.0

Camping while disabled/after surgery,"Hi y’all! My troop is going to a camporee this fall, which I am attending (it is not possible for me to not go). The kicker is, I’ll have just had ACL surgery a few weeks ago.

For context, this camporee is entirely accessible. My troop will be in an accessible campsite, most things will be paved as it is in a city, and besides grass I will not be encountering any rough terrain. I was initially very skeptical, but my troop has had conversations with the camporee organizers (which include the mayor of the city and the national park organization) and they say it is no problem. The entire thing will be wheelchair accessible except for my actual tent. I will be bringing a cot to make things easier.

Also as a note I am a youth and my troop/adult leaders have assured me this will not be a problem. My mother will be attending (not just for me she is an adult leader), and we are going to reach out to council and ask for permission to share a tent.

What to do when applying for the first time ,"So my partner has had a hard life, especially financially. From what I understand,when he first graduated high school and tried to go to college, he filled out all the paperwork about his family's situation, and he was essentially told that there was no way that his family survived on what was reported, so he had to be lying, and he was banned for applying for any federal assistance for years. That has had him very gunshy about trying anything else. 

Together, we're in a much better place financially, but due to several undiagnosed issues, both physical and mental, he cannot work, and so we need to get him on disability, or at least try to. He doesn't have health insurance. I told him to just go apply, because I assume getting a denial letter is the first step of trying to get the process started of we wanted to go through a lawyer route. He's hesitant to do that without any proof because of what happened with college.

He says that he needs to go to a doctor first, to get a physician to sign off on the things that would qualify him for disability, and that requires money for an appointment. I was under the impression that if you apply, then the state pays for you to see an approved physician to verify if you're full of shit or not.

Trouble getting comfortable enough to sleep,"
My sweet wife was severely injured in an accident four years ago. She’s doing pretty well all things considered but struggles with getting comfortable to sleep at night. To clarify, she has very few issues with actually sleeping but can’t really lie comfortably anymore which makes it difficult for her to relax enough to sleep even when she’s very tired. Before her injuries, she would lie on her right side every night but because her right leg was badly damaged, it hurts too much for her to put this much pressure on it. She’s had so many abdominal surgeries that her belly is pretty much always slightly swollen and tender, so obviously painful to lie on. Lying on her back is also pretty uncomfortable for her and she likes to be kind of curled up. Unfortunately, even on her side, she can’t really bend her legs enough to get comfortable like that. 

We’ve tried a pregnancy pillow style body pillow to support her body a bit more and reduce the pressure on her stomach, but she doesn’t really like this as she feels she’s stuck in one position and can’t really move around in bed, reach to rearrange the covers if she’s too hot or cold or whatever. Even before her injury, she liked to either hold me or have me hold her when she’s sleeping, and the pillow makes that level of closeness difficult. At the moment, she’s so uncomfortable in bed that I’ve been trying to keep her up a bit later so she just drops off on the sofa, because when we’re watching tv or reading, there isn’t really that same expectation to fall asleep and so she doesn’t fuss about getting comfortably and just falls asleep naturally when she needs. However, I can’t do this every night. Because I don’t like to leave her to spend the night by herself in the living room, I’ve been going to sleep on the floor which isn’t ideal.

There’s no single sleeping position that works consistently every night. Sometimes, I can get her comfortable on her back but it takes about an hour of me massaging her hands and shoulders  for her to fall asleep. Other nights, I end up sitting up so she can either lie in my lap or sit next to me with her head on my shoulder, and she goes to sleep surprisingly quickly like that. She can sometimes lie on her left side, especially if I lie facing her and cuddle her. However, most of this requires me to stay awake longer than she does and if we’ve had a long day, I just doze off as soon as my head hits the pillow. 

Any advice on finding a comfortable position to fall asleep would be appreciated. Just to clarify, once she’s fallen asleep, she’s out for the night. She doesn’t want to be strongly medicated as she’s been put on strong tranquillisers/ sedatives/ pain meds in the past and hates how disconnected they make her feel. She’ll use them after surgeries/ when she’s sick or in hospital but not as an everyday thing. At the moment, she occasionally takes melatonin before bed but not all the time, as she’s generally very sleepy at night but uncomfortable and the melatonin obviously doesn’t take away her discomfort. She has regular prescribed pain meds and we stay on top of them.

"Is it legal for my employer to make me get ""re-certified"" every 6 months for them to provide reasonable accommodations for my permanent disabilities?","For reference, I live in Oregon, US. I work as a cashier/ self-checkout attendant at a retailer. I have hEDS and other comorbidities. My accommodation request was for me to be able to sit down as needed while working. When I originally made this request last summer, I spoke to 3 or 4 different managers who told me that I just needed a doctor's note and that it would be easy to accommodate. (There are other coworkers who use a chair in the same way.) I provided a doctor's note saying that I had permanent disabilities and that I needed to use a chair as needed. I turned in my note to upper management and was then told it wasn't sufficient. She said I would either need to provide a note with an end date within 1 year, or to work with a 3rd party called AbsenceOne to verify the need for a long-term accommodation.  
  
I came back with a note dated within 1 year (through mid-October 2024). I was then told that regardless of the length of time for my accommodation, that I would need to work with AbsenceOne. Long story short, after multiple trips to the doctor, a ton of back-and-forth with management, AbsenceOne, and HR, my employer agreed to make my accommodation permanent. So imagine my surprise when my manager approached me a few weeks ago and said my accommodation is expiring at the beginning of August. I let her know that my accommodation is permanent and that my doctor is always booked for several weeks out, so I wouldn't be able to get the paperwork in time in any case. My manager says she's willing to work with me on the accommodation as long as I can get new paperwork ASAP. I spoke with HR and AbsenceOne again and was told that I need to provide paperwork every 6 months to re-certify my need for accommodation. This seems to conflict with EEOC guidelines unless I'm misinterpreting anything. Has anybody gone through something similar or know if this is a reasonable request from my employer?",1,1eyycr4,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eyycr4/is_it_legal_for_my_employer_to_make_me_get/,4,1724370650.0

Am I rude for feeling like my best friend is inconsiderate of my disability?,"I always keep my friends and family updated but unfortunately not to my best friend. This ""best friend"" of mine is a girl I met online that i've known for 3 years, I have close friends in person but me and her just have so many similar interests. She has no disabilities so it may be hard for her to understand. When we met up in the beginning of this year she had tore her ACL in December right before a big competition in my town that she was supposed to attend. While she was there for a week, she complained about how miserable her life felt not being able to compete and brushed it off laughing about being an athlete girl whos disabled. I felt slightly offended because she was complaining about not being able to do a sport because of a temporary disability while I had to give up on that same sport because my permanent disability progressed and I might never be able to do it again since theres no cure. Yet all the frustration I held in my feelings and never said a word. A couple months later after she's recovered she stops talking to me, we used to call all the time and play video games online when she was recovering from her surgery. Now thats shes in her normal life again all she does is occasionally snap me on snapchat but never offers to call and when I do she says shes busy. This makes me feel worthless to her and I feel like a replacement friend or someone she only talks to when shes bored. She has a busier life than me and travels around the states but that doesn't make it impossible to contact a friend from time to time. Now last week I had entered a clinical trial for my disability and I had to get a punch biopsy for my muscle on my calf. I was telling all my friends and family because I was excited to finally get a chance to help my disability get better. This is the part that annoyed me most, I message her after surgery saying ""The biopsy went well, I think this medicine is really going to work I have hope."" And she replies ""Biopsy for what?"" Now I am confused because I have been telling her this entire month everytime I get updates from my Doctor. I reply ""The biopsy for the trial im in..? For my disability?"" And all she had to say was ""Ohh sorry I forgot."" my response was ""I didn't forget about when you tore your ACL, I was supportive and caring about you."" she said ""I do care about you but you know how I am."" saying that shes forgetful. Now I am pissed off at her because all of my other friends don't act this way and shes the only one who never checks up on me about my trial, she didn't even know when I obviously send her messages that she leaves on opened. She posted on her instagram story stating how its emotional for her to get asked if she has had any past surgeries or injuries. I reply to the story saying ""Some people have it more unfortunate than you, maybe be more happy that you healed from it and can continue doing your sport."" She left my reply on read and hasn't texted me since. Im thinking I was too rude with that comment but she never checks up on me, maybe I am expecting to much out of her.

Inaccessibile invites,"I am feeling so frustrated right now. 
Here's what happening: my boyfriend's brother in law's birthday is tomorrow and I was invited to his birthday party. I knew that the place won't be very accessible but I thought I could make it with help from my bf. I am a manual wheelchair user but I can walk short distances if assisted. I talked to bf about it and we decided we would go. Today, bf calls me and says the location is very beautiful but totally inaccessibile (only reachable by walking down a trail with multiple sets of steep stairs) and the tables are also high and uncomfortable. He says he thinks I should not go because we've been in a similar situation before and it's not been enjoyable for me or for him. He still wants to go without me though because his brother in law is also his best friend.
I don't blame him, but I think his sister should have taken my access needs into account when planning the party/inviting us. Brother in law and I are not super close but we get along, it's not like I wanted a totally accessible location but this seems to be the opposite. Bf says his sister only realized it would be a problem for me after booking because she's not used to 'wheelchair life ' and they want to go there because it's his favorite bar. I don't want bf to miss out on the party because I know it's important for him since he doesn't see his sister and bil often, so I would never ask him not to go. 
I am used to missing out on stuff because of lack of accessibility but when such things happen I still get frustrated and sad because I wish I was able to be there for my bf and his family and experience things together like everyone else.",3,1eynuep,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eynuep/inaccessibile_invites/,2,1724344322.0

"Unpopular Opinion: I hate the toxic positivity in the disability community as a whole, of especially people who never knew what it was like to lose one or more of your senses, telling someone to not process their emotions. ","I'm sorry, but it's so invalidating and ignorant for people in my community for example, the blind and visually impaired, to tell someone how everything they once did has a ""replacement"". Or that dreams and achievements once very important to someone ""won't matter if they just keep moving forward.""

We ARE moving forward, but we all must grieve and let ourselves process the emotions that come with this feeling of loss. If we don't let ourselves feel what we need to feel, the frustration we deny will only bleed into our relationships and form unrealistic expectations about the life ahead.

I will never for get in college for example, a seminar I was in for blind and visually impaired students. At the time my vision was near-perfect, sans the nightblindness. There was this one young woman who was an accomplished long-distance runner who was granted a scholarship for her athletic achievement. She could no longer do that sport however, due to a severe infection that spread to both eyes. I will refer to her as Jane; she was left with total blindness in her left eye and 20/300 vision at best correct, in the right. Another young man I'll call Alex, had been visually impaired since birth; Alex had less than 20 degrees of peripheral vision since birth.

Jane opened up about how devastated she was about losing her vision the prior year, as she could no longer do what she loved the most. Alex chimes in with all manner of ""repplacements"" such as stationary bikes, jumprope, or weightlifting. Those things are forms of activity sure, but they were not what she spent the better part of her youth perfecting, only to have LOST it all. Why would someone not be depressed or anxious, or at the very least need time to process that? Alex went on about how we need to move forward with our lives and that wallowing in your own misery will not help anyone. Mind you, Alex himself never was a track and field athlete, nor was he as accomplished as a student as Jane. I feel it is worth saying that because in my experience, I've come accross blind and visually impaired athletes who would have understood, empathized, and respected Jane's perdicament.

Emapthy to me means that you understand a person has needs outside of your own that they need, in order to thrive. Empathy means you can understand why someone would feel or think about something a certain way, even if it wasn't the thoughts or feelings you yourself would have had.

Mind you, the people being invalidated were already resilient to begin with. I've seen people who worked from the bottom up build strong businesses. Even if disability didn't stop them, they still had to process the new found struggle and talk about it with loved ones. I've seen single parents who provided for and raised their children well for years; especially these people, why wouldn't they be devastated about something like paralysis, blindness, chronic illness or pain, and severe mental illness? Life can still be lived for sure, but resilience can in time be a trauma response, which needs to be treated as such.

In the end, we are humans and have to process emotions as we adapt to our new life. Especially in the disability community as a whole, it is imperative that we support each other and not push on each other the same ableism of society that causes everyone else an isolated quality of life.

As I have always known, the greatest tragedy of disability is not the disability itself, but the ignorance of society's views on those with disability.

It's a shame that even members of our community perpetuate this.

Grieving is as valid an emotion as hope, happiness, and anger.

Lower limb prosthesis in a fantasy novel,"Hi guys, I'm writing a book and one of the characters has to have his lower leg amputated due to a fall. I wanted some advice from those who have experience of this, or something similar, so I can represent this disability accurately. 

For info: it's a medieval esque time period, but has some technology like clocks and blimps. Magic is a resource like any other and can be used, but can't regrow a leg. 

Main things I would like to know:
1) if I were to cut out a chunk of the ""getting used to using his new leg"" time part of having a prosthetic, would that be considered offensive? There is magic in this world, and a wheelchair using character has a magically-power-assisted wheelchair, so I was thinking it would be similar to that, so the learning curve will be shorter? I'm not sure if I feel capable of writing that entire journey, since I've never experienced anything like it, but I'll give it my best shot if that's the consensus 
2) are there any specific things I should know about the healing process or life with a prosthetic that isn't commonly talked about? Particularly within the time period. 
3) would you prefer it to be something that is present from before the start of the book? So, something that is mentioned but normalised? I have another disabled character whose disability has been present throughout. 

I don't want to make this a huge plot point because I want to normalise these characters being disabled, but I still want to make sure I handle this correctly. 

Any thoughts anyone has I'd really appreciate!

"College claims to not be able to provide me a single room, despite my accommodations","I have a variety of disabilities, including urinary incontinence, which makes it quite uncomfortable to live with random people. I refuse to share a room with anyone due to the somewhat embarrassing nature of my disability, and the fact that I've been teased, bullied and harassed by my peers in the past, specifically about my urinary incontinence. I'm okay sharing a general living space with others, so long as I have my room to myself.

For the last two years, I've gotten my urinary doctor to write me a letter for my disabilities stating that I require the single room as part of my accommodations. I've been able to get the single room for the last two years with no issues.

This year, I had quite a lot of issues with the school and financial aid, which left me unable to pay my housing deposit until last week (classes start on September 4th), and therefore without a room, as they do not hold rooms for students, even ones with disabilities.

I found out yesterday that I was assigned to a double room off-campus with somebody I do not know. I do not feel comfortable or even safe sharing a room with somebody I don't know. I reached out to disabilities and told them that I do not feel safe or comfortable in this living situation, and that the single room has been written into my accommodations for the last two years, as well as for the upcoming year.

I was told that I've been put on the priority waitlist for a single, but this is makes me quite anxious, as there's an extremely high chance I could be forced into the double with no other option. They haven't outright said that they're completely out of singles, but given the fact that they didn't just place me in one right away, I'd imagine they have very little or none left.

I'm not the type of person to cause issues, but I'm not quite sure what to do. Is the single room something that the school legally has to give me because it's in my accommodations? Is this something I should even try to argue with the school over?

Edit: Thank you guys!! Everyone's responses have been really helpful. I'm willing to give having a roommate a try, especially since it seems like I don't really have any other option, although I'm still hoping they can do something to get me into a single.

You just wanted the best for me,

Thank you for trying your best,
I’m not ready to let go of you just yet,
But I will one day,
I can’t let you define me forever,
I can’t do that,
I will move on from this.
I will grow,
But trust me I’ll never forget you,
I’ll never forget what you put me through,
How depressed I felt when you stopped me from doing things,
How happy I felt when you slowly started to get better,
Sometimes I regret ever meeting you,
Yet other times I’m grateful I’m not alone in this,
I hate you for hurting me,
But I love you for teaching me how to be patient,
And I love you for keeping me company all this time,
And I love you for comforting me when no one else could,
And I’ll continue to love you even when we eventually part ways.",12,1ey6yzf,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ey6yzf/a_message_to_my_disability_for_myself/,5,1724290161.0

Using a walker in high school,I was recently diagnosed with FND after winding up in the hospital for leg paralysis. I am on the road to recovery but will be using a walker at school to improve safety and reduce pain and fatigue. I  am able to walk by myself but wind up in pain the more I walk and my balance also gets worse the more I walk. This is going to be a temporary thing that I use for a couple of weeks. I have already gotten accommodations for this put in my IEP that I have because I am deaf with 2 cochlear implants. Does anyone have tips on how to deal with other students? This is my first time using a walker at school. I’d also like some tips for how to decorate it. It is a walker with two front wheels. My budget is $20 and I can sew and crochet. I also can buy stuff off of Amazon. Any tips or ideas would be greatly appreciated,7,1eya2pg,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eya2pg/using_a_walker_in_high_school/,7,1724299526.0

Handshake with someone with arm disability,"One of my new clients had an arm disability. I cannot find exactly the name (would appreciate help), but his arms are underdeveloped as in they are very small but he has hands and fingers. I am so sorry I am almost definitely not using the right language (guidance appreciated!). I will be meeting him alongside others from his team. 

Should I offer a handshake?  If not, what is appropriate here?

Edit - thank you everyone for your input!  I ended up sending him an email this AM and he suggested a fist bump. New question - which hand should I use??

Just kidding - appreciate all the perspectives. Plus good to learn the “limb difference”terminology. ",55,1exst4k,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1exst4k/handshake_with_someone_with_arm_disability/,40,1724254688.0
Not disabled enough,"Does anyone feel in limbo. I have a moderate physical disability as well as anxiety and depression. I’m lucky that I’m currently employed but if I lost my job I would be screwed. No one would hire me b/c of my limitations and anxiety interviewing etc. I would require a WFH job which is harder to come by. I don’t qualify for any benefits like disability or other programs but as my condition deteriorates as I get older I will likely need support or some type of disability.

So scared: Can't get APS to help me & about to lose electricity,"I'm so sorry to panic post, but I really need advice. I called APS in Texas for myself a little over a week ago. The person who did the intake said she'd escalate the investigation bc I have an electricity disconnect notice, can't pay rent, and can't get to my walker. (My power was supposed to be disconnected on  8/20, but it's on hold until tomorrow morning due to a heat advisory).   
  
The APS investigator assigned to me came out the next day and rang the doorbell but left before I could get to the door. Since then, he hasn't responded to any phone calls or text messages. I've called the hotline multiple times, and 4 days ago, an on-call investigator showed up, took pictures of my disconnect notice and medical info, made sure I ""had food in the house."" She told me the assigned investigator would be handling everything else and left. 

I don't know what to do. I'm post-TBI, and heat is the main trigger for my vertigo and migraines, which cause me to fall and have resulted in additional concussions, an elbow dislocation, fractured kneecap, etc. over the past year. I relocated to my current city due to domestic violence, and the only person I know here is my 83-year-old mother, who is not only abusive but unable/unwilling to help in any way. I would just go to the hospital, but I have two senior rescue dogs living with me and no one to care for them. 

Any suggestions for who to call or what to do? I'm terrified. ",4,1eycdgg,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eycdgg/so_scared_cant_get_aps_to_help_me_about_to_lose/,0,1724307946.0
I feel like the old dog at the shelter. The broken toy at the bottom of a garage sell bin.,"I’m 32f. I’ve spent my entire life from the day I existed hurting.

I remember being 5 on the swing set and slowly rotating where I put my hands on the swing set chains so my back and arms would burn less and I could play longer.

I remember the feeling of my legs at night as a little kid just burning and the pounding heart beat in them.

I remember days crying in the counselors office because I couldn’t hold my pencil the “right” way and being forced to write page after page because the way I gripped the pencil was wrong- but their right way hurt so much.

I just figured that’s life. This is normal.

Weekends I stayed in resting from long weeks at school. And week days I couldn’t wait to sit on the bottom of the shower.

I was treated as lazy.

When I turned 18 I joined the Army and served 7 very painful years. But I kept my head down and I hurt quietly. I figured I was being weak because no one else ever spoke about hurting the way I did.

Every ruck my hips burned. They burned so much I couldn’t sleep through the night. After long rucks I’d fight back tears. The pain felt like it was steaming out from the inside of my bones.

Then I had my first baby at 25. 
My heart just pounded out of my chest half way through. Standing was hell. Trying to breathe felt like someone was sitting on my chest. Existing was pain.

But I saw lots of pregnant women doing just fine so I kept my mouth shut.

My dad used to joke he knew when I was around the corner because the cracking sounds my body would make when I walked.

But I wanted to overcome I wanted to be strong I wanted to be normal- so pushed hard with everything I had. 

I was angry.

I wanted to prove it to myself and to everyone else I wasn’t some lazy effortless type.


So I trained day and night no matter how much it hurt I pushed. 

I ran marathons.
I climbed mountains.
I hike with weights on my back.
I ran with weights on my chest.

I worked out 4-6 hours a day 4-6 days a week the next 9 years.

I landed modeling gigs.
I kept under 18% body fat at all times.
I never tipped toed over 115lbs.
I counted every macro and every calorie in and out.

But my body slowly dissolved.

Every pain the doctors said was fake.
Every cardiac event was called anexity.
Every seizure I was told was stress.
Every burst vein I was told was from unknowingly holding my breath.
Every time the right side of my face fell they would call code stroke and I’d be sent home the same questioning my sanity.

You couldn’t be both in top fitness and crippling ill. I was a young healthy female they said over and over.

Then I got pregnant with my son.

My hips dislocated every week. 
Nightly I’d grab a wall and twist my shoulder back into the socket.

Soon enough I needed a chair in the shower, at the sink and in the kitchen.

Towards the end I was in a wheelchair.

The pain was so consuming to calm myself I’d read about assisted suicide.

Just to feel control that the option to escape my body existed and that I only was here in this pain because I was allowing it to happen.

At night I’d crawl the floors the last month of my pregnancy.

The bed was too soft and as I lay too long on anyone side I’d hear the snap of another bone pushed out of place

My heart was too weak to stand long and my valves were leaking. A hole had been found in my “floppy” heart that had been pressed open wide from my blood pressure.

They said my heart was like a whirlpool.

So with my cannula in my nose I’d crawl like a wounded animal on the floor piling and reshaping pillows and blankets desperately attempting to make a nest to hold my body in place until the sun came up.

And then I’d accept the defeat of taking a norco to dim the pain long enough to block out my suicidal escapist thoughts the desperation would bring.

Every time I’d swallow a pill I’d look down at my pregnant belly feeling that same failure that same life long weakness no one else seem to have.

Every night began a routine. How long could I keep off the oxygen so I could sit on that chair in the shower questioning my sanity, the validity of the pain.

Was the pain even real or was it so weak I was poisoning my baby and I with these pain pills.

Burdening my husband with overplayed complaints of agony I was manifesting.

Why could I just stop it. Just fucking stop hurting. Stop complaining. Just be fucking strong.

My abs were gone.

In their place were dozens of tiny bruises from my nightly lovenox injections.

Covered in shame I’d waddle past my husband to the pill dispenser

The pretty model outdoors wife he had signed up for was now in shambles and without knowing it he had tied himself to a life long mess that crumbles as soon as it’s reassembled 

I was in the way

In the way of everything he loved 

The outdoors that brought us together 
The lucid mind for meaningful conversation 
The pretty trophy wife to stand by his side
The adventurous, active catch was gone.

I was dead weight pulling him away from his career he loved.

I was a distraction in any photo of him that could have been perfect had he not tied himself to the embarrassment I had become

I did not fit the picture he had made or wanted 

So I cried in the pain as quietly as I could

My pride was dead
My dignity had left


And all I had worked to make myself with it

My heart couldn’t take another day and so I was sent for surgery to have my baby 

My poor baby who has been given a broken, breathless mother.

And I carry him at night and as I twist my knee caps crack off and on their tendons

And when I sit after I finally get him to sleep I carefully wait until he sinks into my arms well enough I know the sound of me bending my wrists back into place won’t wake him

The world loved me because it was shallow and what it loved me for was always fleeting

But I loved me for my heart, my drive for the strength I found to go places and do things most people never do

And now I’m this.

Something else.

A thing in the way.

A tired worn down wife in the way of my husbands work reputation, his paddle boarding, his weekly errands.

I fear when my baby can walk because he will slowly come towards the age of realizing how tired I am

And my 9 year old has already made it known that I’m like a used up broken down toy that’s borning now.

"AITH'ish post, or OffMyChest, not sure, venting.","I'm severely disabled, severe scoliosis, so it's very obvious. I can't say I don't care how I look. I'm not a vain person, I don't need to be beautiful, I just wish I was less deformed.   

Now, I know what you'll say, most people don't care how I look and that's true to an extent. There's always assholes that wont even hide their disgust, or thoughtless folks that has knee-jerk reactions when they see me, but most people are courteous.  

On to the point of my post...  

I had a bad couple of months. I got bad news, one after the other, so I felt down. For some god forsaken reason I made an account on a dating service.. I guess I wanted to see if I had a ""normal"" physique, would I be attractive, able to get a date, find a partner, a ""what-if"" fantasy..  

After a while I got in touch with someone. Two of them kind of fizzled out, but the third person, she was great. We texted a lot, almost daily, eventually talked, it felt so easy, natural. Common interests, wants, goals, a great match. After the third week it became obvious, I had to tell her the truth. So far I had just danced around the topic, been vague, but she wanted to meet up..  

I knew I had done a shitty thing, and I wont lie, a part of me wanted the fantasy to keep going. Talking with her was a highlight in my day..  

I told her, in a long text, apologizing for my one lie, though a big one.  

After two days I got a text from her. She thanked me for telling her, and that she didn't want any further contact. Wished me well.  

I regret everything, from making that account to the obvious conclusion. I feel like an asshole for not considering other peoples feelings, I feel worse now than I did before. I don't know how to move on from this, I don't want to live the life I'm heading for.

Advice on my potential medical malpractice case?,"I’m copying and reposting what the mods removed from r/legaladvice, which is dumb because I used the medicine and malpractice flair they provide only to be told medical malpractice has no place on their sub.  

Hi all, I’ve recently changed neurologists and I’m absolutely shocked and furious. One MRI and they found a chiari malformation that’s been causing such severe health problems that not just me, but my *doctor*, was pretty sure it was MS. My quality of life is nearly nothing and has been worsening gradually since I was born. This makes a lot of sense since chiari is present at birth. This is where it gets messed up.  

My last neurologist, who I’d been seeing since I was roughly 13 and finally gave up on this year, has done a minimum of three MRIs on me. I know it’s at least that much, though I don’t remember if more were done through his office. As my migraines periodically worsened we checked repeatedly for tumors and every time they told me the MRI was completely normal, detected nothing. It’s tempting to write this off as the doctor not specifically looking for chiari and therefore missing it, which is already not great, but in 2019 my ex-boyfriend of all people became concerned I might have a chiari malformation and I took this concern to this doctor. He reminded me that I’d just had an MRI the previous year and that he could see that I didn’t have one. He told me that we could do it if it would make me feel better but it would be a waste of time and money. His tone heavily implied I was a hypochondriac and I decided not to do the MRI because of it.  

This alone is bad enough, but what made me give up on this neurologist this year was that I found out he was prescribing me both the autoinjector and syringe of my migraine medicine. Because of this they were able to charge me a fee to submit a prior authorization for the same medication every 3 months — every time one would be up they’d switch to that one. I had no idea and supposedly no one in their office caught it. For over a year.  

On top of that, when DHR required me to get a doctor’s signature for EBT saying I’m long term disabled and cannot work, this doctor’s nurse berated me in the middle of the waiting room. She went on about how migraines are not a disabling condition, how she has migraines and has to work so I can too. During this conversation she let slip that she’s filled out every school & legal form for all patients the entire time I’ve been going to this doctor. A few years ago I was denied for disability on the grounds that my migraines aren’t a primary headache disorder — I thought this was odd at first because I’ve never EVER been diagnosed with a primary disorder that’s causing the migraines. I now know that this same woman filled out the forms that went to my disability claim. Considering my doctor had readily available proof for the root of my problems but never diagnosed one and still led SSDI to believe there was one, this seems potentially malicious to me. However, I know this part is not concrete evidence. I do wonder if there’s any degree to which this could help my case.  

My sister insists I should sue for medical negligence and I can’t say I disagree. My life might have actually been ruined by this man’s practice. What should I expect? Do you have any advice? I also don’t know if there’s any record of me asking for a test for chiari, but there are definitely records of the MRIs they did on me previously. My first step, I’d assume, is a consult with a local lawyer. I’d still like to be prepared though, so hit me with your thoughts. Especially because a settlement would go a LONG way toward surgery to fix my chiari and finally give me a life.",0,1eyezvq,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eyezvq/advice_on_my_potential_medical_malpractice_case/,2,1724318952.0
TTY devices??? Should use it if I’m hard of hearing?,"I’m a 27F with Cerebral palsy and bilateral Sensorineural hearing loss. I’m a receptionist with a trade school in my area.

Disability Insurance Payee,"My mother has been my Rep-Payee of my SSDI (for mental and some physical health detriments) since 2010, and as of last week (Pretty much mid August 2024) suddenly told me she dropped me as my rep-payee, probably because I accused her of misappropriating my money and having too many questions about undocumented money. There are a lot more issues going on between us beyond that, but further more, she is the landlord of the small house I am renting from her (she doesn't live in or come to this house ever, really) and I am now being forced to leave by the end of August (in nine days). Social Security told me yesterday that my money is frozen till I find a replacement Rep Payee. My Mother, who never really supported me or had my best interests at heart, knew my money would be frozen and she is kicking me out, leaving me homeless and penniless to save myself. I had procured a case manager, back in March of 2024, because my mother was just getting out of hand and I needed a way out of her clutches. He, unfortunately, is totally useless, gives me dead-lead resources, never visits me OR keeps suddenly rescheduling meet-ups and my life is/was getting worse. I have been trying to get help and advice from local non-emergency police, the court, Disability rights (which I just cant get a bloody hold of for months via emails and phone calls) and the abuse hotline (who the counselors just have me on infinite wait, after being transferred from the receptionists, and I give up after over 20 minutes of wasting my government phone minutes). The local church I go to didnt help me attain family counseling to assist me in forming a relationship with my mother, like Ive never had, and she purposely sabotaged it totally, regardless. Ultimately, I have been making hundreds of calls and getting circled around and having time wasted being transferred the same useless people. Despite trying to live a peaceful life, within my means, my mom's ASPD from past trauma is stating to elevate, I am repeatedly getting financially and emotionally abused by her, and I AM the one going homeless. Is there any possible help I can find, or do I just try to take my life, again? Also, since April 4th, I was placed on the ""Section 8 path program"" waiting list, set up by a female social worker, who is not my useless male social worker, to get affordable housing, to get out of my mom's rental property, anyways. Yet, come to think of it, how was I going to have control of my money if she wasn't going to do it anymore, like I had specified multiple times, and yesterday my local Social Security office denied my request to become my own rep payee. I hate generic spouted answers from agencies and people of authority that are false garbage! I cant get help from people who actually know what they are doing now-a-days. Do I seek litigation help? My mom is doing criminal acts and lying to the face of the government now, as in hurtful character defamation, and I dont know why or what her angle is, and she is believed at first glance, even behind my back and I am not allowed to explain myself or show my proof/receipts I have compiled to corroborate my story of her neglect and exploitation of me! I HAVE noticed that since I called her out on gaslighting my life, and in refusing to be her marionette any longer, she has become more disgusting towards me...This has to be totally illegal and I need to be able to exercise some protection as a Disabled individual here! Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.

"Interabled couple, my partner is a new wheelchair user and I am having some feelings","This is more of a rant/ramble than a question, but any point of view or advice is welcome. 

My partner and I have been together for over a year now and we are very happy together, overall the relationship is very healthy and stable. We are a physically interabled couple. We are both autistic and I am ADHD as well, but I don't feel comfortable calling myself disabled. My partner was not fully aware of their physical disability until about 6 months into our relationship. They have POTS and EDS. 

At first they were using a cane on bad chronic pain days, but the pain has got bad enough for them to get a wheelchair. We've talked about the idea of using a chair in the past, but we both thought it would be a few years out. I am (obviously) in full support of them using a chair, but I am still feeling a vague sense of anxiety around it. 

I know the way the general public treats wheelchair users and I'm worried that people will treat them as less since they are in a chair. People already stop us to ask unwanted questions about their service dog. We just want to go about our tasks without being harassed. And then there's accessibility issues going places, not every place has room for a chair or ramps. 

This is about my partner, not me. I am not the one going through chronic pain, I didn't have to make the hard decision to use a wheelchair. Yet, I still feel sad.

Looking for jar/can/bottle opener recommendations,"Hi all, I'm looking for jar/can/bottle opener recommendations.

I have joints that dislocate and lock easily, and struggle to hold small objects. When opening jars recently I keep dislocating my wrists and fingers, and generally it is incredibly painful to try and open things. I have had several jars that I simply cannot open, and would like to open, stuck shut four about two weeks now.

This was not an issue until recently, because my roommate who opens things for me has moved out. Didn't know how blessed I was with that act of kindness until now.

Does anyone have recommendation for openers that are a little more bulky (to hold onto) but still open things with minimal effort?

Thank you in advance",3,1exwcv6,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1exwcv6/looking_for_jarcanbottle_opener_recommendations/,0,1724263074.0
Looking for a piece of writing about disability and partnerships.,"A while back, don't know how long, I came across a very emotional piece of writing. From what I recall, its someone wondering if their partner would still stay or put up with the limitations and worsening conditions. Asking if they were unable to tale care of themselves, would they be willing or want to take care of them still? It was kind of in that line of thinking of being disabled, potentially getting worse and wondering if your healthy partner will be able to or willing or wanting to still be there for you.

How to help an overlooked disabled adult ,"There is a non verbal man where I live. He points, waves and makes gestures. He's completely mute / cannot speak. People overlook him and say things like ""oh he's crazy"" ""he's not right in the head"" ect. At the shop, when he makes a motion that he's thirsty and gives money, people say ""Give him whatever juice it's not like it matters.""

For context I'm in the Caribbean and we are behind 30 years when it comes to disabilities ect.

It's sad that he never even got a tablet to press the buttons and it speaks... 

I was thinking I could make him one of those communicating boards and print it out? Things like yes / no / I want .. ect . I'm 90% sure he was never taught to read so maybe a chart with only pictures.

My doctor seems less concerned about my test results than he should be (update),"A couple days ago I made a post here about my doctor’s response to some blood work I got. In the original post you can see all the specifics of my test results. With this information I have subclinical hypothyroidism. When I did my own research through accredited journals or sites like Harvard’s medical publications I saw a list of symptoms that match up a lot with my issues. Initially my doctor said no medication and just to monitor my levels. After seeing your responses to my post I pushed back a bit and asked about the medication levothyroxine as well as a referral to an endocrinologist.

I finally got a response today and to summarize he told me that 
1) “Thyroid disease generally has very nonspecific symptoms” 
2) We should wait until my “free T4 numbers are abnormal before initiating treatment” 
3) He confirmed I have subclinical hypothyroidism but that it is “usually is not treated with levothyroxine.”

I’m a little confused because whenever I did research on subclinical hypothyroidism it came with a list of symptoms that overlap with mine pretty consistently. I was also under the impression that subclinical hypothyroidism was high TSH (which I have) alongside a normal T4 level (which I also have) so I’m not sure why it wouldn’t be treated until my T4 levels were also abnormal. Another thing I’m confused about is that it wouldn’t be treated with levothyroxine since every time I look up treatment options that seems like the most frequently used medication…

I’d love the input of other on here with subclinical hypothyroidism on what treatments they have taken and if they had to wait until their T4 levels changed. And thank you to everyone who suggested I advocate for myself about this because my doctor has agreed to refer me to an endocrinologist which makes me really excited!",29,1exgdjc,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1exgdjc/my_doctor_seems_less_concerned_about_my_test/,32,1724213718.0
Hidden physical disability and making it obvious,"Hi

I have a kaput ankle and it is braced, strapped, wrapped within an inch of its life just so i can walk. However, I'm 6ft tall and no one is looking at my ankle or the slow disjointed way I walk and I'm finding everyone under the sun, including obviously disabled people, are getting angsty and hostile with me. I obviously look like a dawdling tourist or something.

How do I make it obvious to people I'm actually struggling to walk without wearing a massive banner stating the obvious?

Should I use a crutch even though I dont need and it would actually aggravate my other joints (I have ehlers danlos and crutches cause me wrist problems).

Or is there some other mobility aid that is noticeable which I could appropriate when I'm trying to navigate the hostile mobile world.

The Harsh Reality of Unemployment for People with Disabilities: How Do We Stop Feeling Like a Burden?,"I’m struggling with something that I think a lot of people with disabilities might relate to. Finding a job is hard enough in today’s economy, but when you have a disability, it feels almost impossible. There’s this constant pressure to contribute, to not feel like a burden to your family, but how do you do that when the job market is already tough for everyone, let alone for someone like me?

I’ve applied to countless jobs, tailored my resume, and tried to highlight my skills, but it often feels like my disability is the first thing employers see. And then there’s the emotional toll – this feeling of not pulling your weight, of being more of a financial strain than a support. It’s exhausting.

I’m curious – for those of you who are also navigating unemployment or underemployment with a disability, how are you coping? Have you found ways to break through the barriers? How do you deal with the feelings of guilt or frustration?

And for anyone who’s been able to find meaningful work, what advice do you have for the rest of us?

Let’s talk about this. How do we stop feeling like we’re a burden and start feeling valued?",112,1ex57ok,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ex57ok/the_harsh_reality_of_unemployment_for_people_with/,57,1724183610.0

Should I use a cane?,"I've been experiencing vertigo and dizzy spells for about 4-5 years and I have a balance disorder called PPPD, and I'm constantly dizzy, and I often get extremely dizzy whenever I stand up, sometimes even when I just turn my head or turn around, and I get very dizzy walking around and I often have to hold on to objects or walls or sit back down because I'm so unstable.

Is It Typical For Parents To Have Conversations About Their Child's Disability With The Child Themself?,"Not too long ago, I found out that this whole time I was diagnosed with Selective Mutism way back when I was 9. So naturally, I assumed that my mother purposefully hid my diagnosis from me but she claims that she didn't and that she told me some time after I got diagnosed and because I was young, I must've not remembered what she said. 

I asked how come I've never heard her, my brother, family members, therapist, etc, ever use the term before then in all these years? She admits that she and everyone else never actually said the term around me because ""everyone knew about it so saying the word didn't seem necessary"". Something along those lines, it was a very bizarre reasoning to me. And it turned out that my brother never knew I had SM either and the first time he heard the word is when he heard my mother and I talk about it a couple of months ago. 

She also claims that she told him when one day he asked her basically what was wrong with me and again said that because he was young, he didn't remember it. 

Is this normal and typically what parents do?? They tell the child and their siblings about the disability one time and after that, they just don't ever use the word again or have any in depth conversations about it because ""everyone now knows""? So if you don't remember, then sucks to be you? Like I never heard her say anything like ""Hey, have you ever told your friends about your SM so they would understand you better and know why you don't speak?"" or ""Hey son, I found this book and a video about SM that I think will help you out a little."" 

Conversations and discussions that I'm guessing are standard to have but they never happened because saying the word Selective Mutism just didn't seem necessary? Idk man, this situation seems shady to me. My diagnosis supposedly wasn't supposed to be this secret that I can't know about but at the same time for over a decade no one in our household never heard or used the name of my disability ONE time? I feel like you have to put in some kind of effort to do that as a parent, there is just no way it just never came up. I really don't know what to think. Maybe I'm in the wrong for thinking this way?

At least my brother also not knowing was validating. I was really starting to think that I had some faulty memory where I somehow and for some reason just didn't the remember the name of the disorder that impacts my everyday life.

This is not the suffering Olympics,"I don’t care that “other people have it worse” I don’t care that you have other patients who are worse off than I am.

I 'advocated' and made my case manager cry... Now I feel like shit.,"For some background, in March I was hospitalized in an absolute hellish ltac because my boyfriend had to learn to care for me, and we were promised additionally hours in a max of 2 weeks from discharge.

So my boyfriend became my full time caregiver. He CHOSE it. However, we were told we'd have more help. I'm more than a full time job.

My case worker is new and submitted the paperwork wrong, 5 times. 

I kept calling for updates and finally he stopped answering. 

Then Blayze got sick. Not a little. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance and my mom took over. 

Honestly I believe it was complete and utter burnout.

I called my case manager and as politely as possible, chewed him out.

He called me back after 30 minutes and his voice was straining, and so I ask him if he's ok, and he tells me he feels frustrated. I ask why and he says, I'm failing. I'm failing you and Blayze and I'm frustrated with myself and for you guys. He apologized profusely. For EVERYTHING. 

We came up with a game plan. He has sent the paperwork one last time, and if it fails he'll go to his supervisor. 

I want to advocate, but I never want to make someone cry or feel like a failure. But I'm also so grateful he apologized and is finally working with me. And without a doubt, he has messed up.

I use a wheelchair and it's a normal lightweight custom wheelchair, it's not one of those fancy ones that have the capability of standing or anything.

I started class last week. There was an assignment which required the use of paper towels (there's a paper towel dispenser in the room) but I couldn't reach it. I asked for the teacher if she could help or if anyone else could assist me and she said no. Then she proceeded to tell me I could continue without the paper towels but I got points taken off for not having it. This wasn't the only time she's done this though in the one week since school's started. She's told us to grab things before which were placed on a high shelf and wouldn't help me, and I instead had to get a student to help me but I was told other students wouldn't always be available to help and I was like... okay? 

I've talked to another staff member about this but she basically told me to drop out. She gave the reasoning that ""not all accommodations are possible"" instead of listening to me and told me ""well we could give blind people all the accommodations in the world and they still wouldn't be able to drive a car so accommodations have limitations"" but I don't think that simply asking for someone to grab paper towels for me is such a big deal?

Anyways I contacted disability services who told me to call the Title IX coordinator but she told me that she wasn't the right person to contact. 

Who would I contact about this? Do you guys have any ideas? Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask

Edit: I just wanted to add that it's not just her being unhelpful. She takes points off of multiple of my assignments already for things like not being able to get materials. And when she was showing us the computer lab in the building where we can take the tests we have online, I couldn't get there when she was showing the class because the elevators were down at the moment for whatever reason and she didn't take me and she even called me out for it (to be specific she said ""I don't give paper tests so you'll have to find some way to get yourself to the lab). Like this is blatant discrimination right? Or am I imagining things and overreacting?

a rant from a throwaway,"26m

I don't know what to say.

An unfortunate truth, I don't belong in this world.

I successfully hid my mental disabilities to my own detriment.

I realized I couldn't continue working about a year ago. I was in a downward spiral for a very long time.

Withdrew all of my money and decided I would just survive until it ran out.

I've overstayed my welcome.

My debt is astronomical now.

I found a lump on my testicle a few weeks ago, the cherry on top.

No friends or family to rely on.

No insurance. Haven't seen a doctor in years.

Mental health getting worse. Sleeping around eighteen hours a day.

I live in the shadows of society.

I'm envious of people who have the bare minimum. I've grown to hate the people who have it all.

The world is dystopian and cruel.

I have no will to continue.

No motivation to seek help.

I compare my struggle to others and realize I don't deserve it anyways.

I was generous when I had nothing. I wouldn't be in the position I'm in now if I hadn't been.

You all have it rough.

This isn't a cry for help. This is a warning.

My only regret, don't be like me. Be selfish.

I don't have money for diagnosis or doctor appointments. I don't have money for therapy or treatments. Even if i did, I certainly don't have the energy or time to get all of those things.

Opinion on disability ‘miscalculation’,"Just wanted some feedback on this situation. I’ve been receiving disability insurance for five years. I was fully approved for social security last year (which paid back). 

Two months ago disability came after me wanting a different evaluation (despite the government and a dozen doctors previously verifying my health). I never received a response back, but yesterday they reached out about a payment miscalculation on their part. For five years, they’ve been paying me 42 dollars too much. They now want me to pay them back either in full, chunks or siphoning it. Ironically they go quiet for months at a time, but this happens and they’ve called me several times a day. 

The whole situation feels odd to me and I’d love some feedback.

Idk if I should appeal or not…,"After waiting 19 months, I’ve been denied. My lawyer never seemed very on the ball(to me anyways) and idk if I should wait for them to call me about this or if I should call them. 


Honestly I don’t even know if I’m going to appeal. This is my second denial (first with a lawyer) and I’m tired of all of it. Of the false hope and lack of communication. My body hurts, it’s hard to do day to day things *sometimes* and I just feel like they look at my age and say “nope. Too young.” As if I ASKED for this shit to happen to me. But I know if I “suck it up” and get a job, my body & mind will deteriorate further/faster and it’ll be worse, but at least I won’t have the cloud of finances hovering over my head. Like yes, my husband makes enough for us to survive. But I don’t want to survive, I want to live. I want to feel like I am contributing to this house hold in some way that is actually worth something. 

I just don’t know if I should bother appealing or if I should just pretend I’m fine and get a job and let my body get worse to the point that maybe somebody in the damned disability office will believe me. ",68,1ewipj5,disability,https://i.redd.it/2gf0lw07ypjd1.jpeg,57,1724116046.0
Deaf or hard or hearing people,"I feel like the answer is an obvious don't do that, but I'm gonna ask because I'm curious and a little desperate.

So I do not have any hearing impairment. I want to make that clear. I do have a service dog for mobility reasons, and I also have autism which makes me sometimes go mute so I know a good chunk of asl and can have rough conversations.

I go to a cafe to work on my novel, quite often. About 5 times a week, I'm a professional writer, and that's where I do my best work. The staff know me and my dog and are great, they know my order if I go mute, I love them all!

The problem is I struggle to focus and especially, getting started on writing some days, and once I'm interrupted I have to start all over with trying to get refocused. I usually have about 4 people daily, walk up to my table to talk to me about my dog, and it's stupid conversation, or really personal uncomfortable stuff. I am usually fine with answering everything, or telling them it's not their business anywhere else but at the cafe its effecting my work and writing time, which is my income.

Other methods I've tried:

I've tried using wired earbuds so they see them and get the memo to f off, but I've had many times people will touch me and pull them out to talk. It's incredible rude and I hate being touched especially by strangers, but I live in a town with lots of old people and I'm in my very early 20s and only have hidden disabilities.

I also sit in the back corner away from people, trying to make it clear to leave me alone

I've also tried little signs and stickers telling people to leave me alone, or I'm busy, or even a sheet with the most asked questions and the answers and people just don't look.

Here's the question or the would I be the ass

Could I just pretend to not hear them? Just keep on trucking with my train of thought and completely ignore them, and if they get in my face to get my attention, use some asl so they leave me alone?",8,1ewt1it,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ewt1it/deaf_or_hard_or_hearing_people/,9,1724153152.0

I am a hybrid remote schedule employee, I work 2 weeks at home and 1 in office. I am on intermittent FMLA for my anxiety, depression, and PTSD (almost forgot that one) and it has been really challenging for me to get into office.

Example, I am supposed to be in office this week but am having a bad time with anxiety and my IBS is so flated up I have to remain close to home for the bathroom and any accidents. So, this new PM tells me yesterday to choose a day next week to come into office to make up time I wasn't in office.....although I am still performing my job at home on those days and am not impacted at all.

Dorm Living Accommodations,"I recently moved into a college dorm for freshman year where I'm living with a roommate and using separate communal bathrooms. Everything is great except for the showers and restrooms. I am someone who needs a place to put my things (not on the floor, I am not putting my towel and clothes there) and a place to lean, but these stalls and showers have none. I've tried bringing in extra hooks that sit hanging over the stall door, but I still prefer having some kind of counter for product space and added support.

  
My options are to move to a single room with a private bathroom--which means moving buildings from where all my friends are, or stay where I am and forfeit the ease of basic hygiene/function. Usually I'd say that accommodations take precedence, but I think it's equally as important to maintain friendships and not isolate myself in freshman year of college.

  
Unfortunately the school sees my disability as more of a 'preference' than a need, so when I tried asking if there's an ADA restroom in my building they got really confused since I'm technically able to use the showers and facilities on my floor. Luckily, the student disability center is happy to make the switch, but there's no room for compromise. I really could use some advice on what to do. Should move buildings? Or is there any way to make my current bathrooms accessible?",1,1ex1miw,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ex1miw/dorm_living_accommodations/,0,1724174975.0

After a good 2 hours of answering lots of questions, all I was told is that my pain is mechanical, which just means that it results from movement.  They said that no scan or tests needed to be run, and that I just have to live with it, as I'm able to push through the pain (note: I have had very few tests actually run, only two panels of bloodwork.).  They didn't want to refer me anywhere else until I had done a good year of physio.

My mum is convinced that my weight is the cause of my constant pain,"So, I'll cut right to the chase. My mum is convinced, and lectures me frequently, that my weight is the cause of the constant joint and back pain I've been in for most of my teenage life. I'm 17 now, and I have hypermobility and scoliosis (though a friend of mine is convinced that I might have EDS, because I share almost all of my symptoms with her sister who has EDS, and have some symptoms/traits which aren't really found with hypermobility).

Obviously, my disabilties have been there my entire life, and as such, have caused me lifelong pain and problems. I struggled so much with writing as a child that it was the cause of me being heavily berated and punished by my primary school teachers, and my back pain alone has brought me to literal tears. 

Recently(as in since I was 13), my pain has been getting dramatically worse, and it's only escalating. The doctor I was seeing about my scoliosis said that thankfully, the curvature will not get any worse, but between the two appointments I had with him(a year apart), my shoulders noticeably misaligned, and my posture is pretty bad because of my scoliosis. I have only been to one appointment for my hypermobility, which was my diagnosis when i was 7, and since then I haven't seen any specialists and was not given physiotherapy or any advice on how to manage it. 

But as I said, my pain and discomfort levels have been steadily increasing, and from the start of this year, theyve taken a upwards nosedive. I'm always in some kind of pain, my back always hurts, and every joint in my legs is seeming to become more and more unstable. I had a bout not too long ago of my knees constantly buckling, causing me to fall once. I've also had to sit out of much more activities than I have in the past, purely because my body would not be able to manage it. An hour of non stop walking can cause me agony for the rest of the day. To go more into detail, my lower back hurts like crazy, every joint in my legs feels like their having a nail rammed into them, and my knees and hips constantly threaten to give out. Almost every day I'm brought to the brink of tears by my pain, and I have to fight the urge to simply collapse on the ground until it goes away. Painkillers don't touch it, warm baths and showers don't touch it, nothing I do seems to help. My joints are constantly groaning, clicking, and half-sliding out of place, and I have slight limp that gets worse when the pain does.

So, as I've mentioned, my mum thinks that it's entirely my weight that is the cause of this. Her reasoning is that I didn't have the pain when I was younger and thinner, but the thing is is that yes, I did, just in my arms more than my legs. I will give it to her that, yes, I am a bit overweight, but in no way obese. I don't participate in sport, nor am I a gym goer, but I do have a lot of walks, and I have been swimming for all of my life. I have no interest in sports like football or netball or anything, im much more of an arts person, but I still make sure that im not spending every moment of the day hunched over my work.

We clash a lot because of our differing opinions in my health. She doesn't want to accept the fact that im disabled, or that my disabilties affect my life. She thinks that obsessively watching my weight and diet will be the cure for my disabilties. While I get that my disabilties can be managed by things like that, I also know that weight doesn't really affect it as much as she thinks. I have a friend who also has Hypermobility, stick thin, and suffers more than I do. I'm also a tad weary to take diet and weight advice from my mum, as she used to, and in my opinion, still does have an eating disorder. 

I've tried to talk to her multiple times about my physical condition, but she always wrangles the conversation back to talking about her magical cure. I cant even express how much its affecting me without her somehow pushing the blame onto me, saying my laziness and weight is the only reason I have these problems, so I try to avoid talking to her about it. I have a physiotherapy session scheduled soon, but my mum is convinced that it won't do me any good, and that she doesn't know why I'm expecting them to be able to do anything for me, or magically make all of my pain go away. I don't think this, and I've never expressed this to anyone, I just think maybe getting at least a professional opinion would help. My mum was the one who begrudgingly set up the appointment, but she opted for a video call session rather than in person. She said it was because there was a longer wait time for the in-person one, but I knew this and had told her that I didn't mind waiting a few months if it meant I could see someone face to face. I know that she probably didn't mean it in a bad way, but I just have a feeling that they won't be able to properly help me over the phone. 

I guess im just asking for an opinion, because I don't really know what to believe. My friends think that I need medical Intervention, which is what I think, but there's a little voice in my head that thinks my mother might be right.",50,1ew1ist,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ew1ist/my_mum_is_convinced_that_my_weight_is_the_cause/,46,1724073360.0

For 6 months, I had to rely on my roommates carrying my chair down the front steps and basically carrying me and just left for doctor's appointments. I had to sleep on a mattress in our living room. Our lease ended and we were able to move to a ground floor apartment. 

What do you mean I'm able to leave my house on my own? What do you mean I'm able to sit outside when I need fresh air and watch the sunset and enjoy the fact that I didn't die in an ICU in February? What do you mean I'm able to take my dog on a walk?

The regaining of that independence and autonomy makes me want to f*cking bawl. We had this big rainstorm and I love the rain so much and I was able to watch it from our covered patio.

Job rights ,"TLDR; I’m basically being penalized for being sick and I dont know what my actual rights here are… 

I know this is really long but if you do have the time to read it I could really really use some advice/ help

So I started my job with the government a year ago next Monday and they have your first year as a “probationary period.” As soon as I got this job I communicated with my supervisors about my disabilities and the issues that come with them. I also immediately registered with the ADA. Anyway, I’ve been going THROUGH it health wise and have been coming in an hour or 2 late once ever 3-4 weeks. When I am at work I work SO hard like I do my work and several other peoples and they know that. I had my meeting today where they told me whether they were going to hire me full time or not once my year is over…. and they said they weren’t going to hire me full time because of my attendance issues. Mind you I’m using my earned sick leave time for any time I’m missing at work. We get 4 hours every 2 weeks so it’s literally not even possible for me to be taking off that much. They hired me in another probationary period because my bosses and team “went to bat really hard” for me and executive office wasn’t going to hire me back but my team fought for me. I’m absolutely FLOORED. This means all the rules that come with a probationary period as well as a lower pay. 

My supervisor sucks and honestly has been targeting me since I started my job (my coworkers agree). I dont know what my rights are here because I was 23 when I started this job and this is my first real job and I feel like I’m being punished for being sick which is something I cant control. I’ve been communicating with my supervisors this whole time about my conditions and at this meeting my supervisor said to HR I dont communicate. I’m collecting all of the emails and texts because I have communicated every step of the way- basically she tells me to do things and I do them and then she tells HR I dont. I literally asked her in front of everyone what she’s wants me to be doing because I’m already doing it. It’s just such an environment where these people allow eachother to treat others poorly because they’re friends and have been working together for 20 years. Everything was so fucked up and I was absolutely stunned 99% of the conversation and I started crying because I was so confused and angry. They’re not hiring me back as a full employee (and honestly I’m going to tell them I dont want to work for them at all if they treat people this way) but I was just wondering what I can do in this situation? 

My supervisor has apparently targeted people in the past and the specific unit I work in can’t keep anyone. I dont want her to do this to anyone again and I want her to know that this was disrespectful and discriminatory. I’m going to as for a meeting with  the HR person that was in the meeting and also one who wasn’t so we can have a 3rd opinion. I also want to address each thing about my attendance without my supervisor there so they can get the real story and I’m going to bring them proof that I’m communicating. They said that it’s because i let her know first thing in the morning if I’m not coming in and that i should be giving her notice as soon as I  know I’m not feeling well… one of my conditions is POTS so I’ll go to bed fine and then wake up and faint getting out of bed. I let her know immediately and have had several meetings with her explaining that these episodes aren’t something i can anticipate and these are a life long conditions (I have a lot more than just POTS). Mind you one time I tried to explain things to her she told me she didn’t want to know details because it “crossed a line” so which is it???? The attorneys I work for love me and are always telling everyone how amazing my work is and how the unit couldn’t function without me. I love them and love working for/with them but the people in charge of the support staff are treating me like I take every other day off and don’t do shit when I’m there. I dont know what to do but I feel like this is not okay. ",3,1ewl8nv,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ewl8nv/job_rights/,7,1724123391.0

How do you guys accept being stuck in a crappy situation?! ,"UGHHHHH I want to work so desperately so I can move out and not be treated like crap for the rest of my life but no one will hire me for a remote job. I'm working with the states vocational rehab center and they've basically told me there's no hope of finding a remote position these days. I started applying for ssi (my second time) in January but my lawyer couldn't get things together and my application didn't get processed until this month. I'm just so freaking sick of this. My sister and her husband recently gave me the option to move in with them (that comes with a laundry list of ""rules"") and it makes me sick to think about how much I'll be burdening their lives and complicating their relationship etc. I will have to do chores for allowance and I have zero idea if that'll even come close to covering my monthly costs. I have two pets and am 31 years old and me, my pets, and all of my belongings will have to fit in one tiny bedroom in their house. I just don't even know what to do anymore. Oh and if I move in with them my lawyer said my chances at winning my ssi case will be drastically lower because I'll be in the same court I was at for my previous denial. I know it's better for everyone else if I stay with my partner and better for me in a lot of ways but he treats me so terribly and I just can't handle the idea that I'm going to be stuck in this crap situation for the rest of my crappy life just because no one will even give me a chance to work for them.

Cane - how to keep track of a cane? ,"Good afternoon. 

I can't find anything that fits, so I'm asking for help.  

My Mom has neuropathy in her feet and legs, and a couple of other medical problems. She can walk on her own, and occasionally uses a walker. 

She prefers her cane, which is a basic aluminum one. Unfortunately, she can forget where she left it, and it's a dark color, which can make it hard to find. 

I want to have a tracker on it, so we can find it quickly.  Unfortunately, I haven't found anything ideal.  The strap is long gone. I tried an Orbit stickon some years back, and that was a fiasco. It didn't stick, and finally disappeared - I think it had help coming off, but she swore it didn't.

If we use something like a keychain to attach it, won't that just slide down and then interfere with her walking? 

Suggestions and/or help, please?  

Thank you,
Theresa

Employee with Muscular Dystrophy ,"Backstory: I have Muscular Dystrophy (diagnosed at age 2, way back in the 1990s). I've used a wheelchair full time since I was 11, and saved during college to buy an accessible vehicle. I've worked full time since graduating and getting this van, have been married, had a baby, got divorced, and now have worked at my local government providing solely for my child, who's now 5. Just got an additional fact, my child was also diagnosed at age 2 with MD. I rent an apartment.

We received no financial assistance because we do not qualify. I don't make tons of money and am struggling but still make too much. The van is totally unreliable and a dealership has literally done everything free of charge because they took pity on the situation. But a different reliable vehicle is needed, which is around $60k avg.

My body has grown increasingly weaker the past couple years and I can barely dress myself. When I do I feel the need for a 10 hour nap. I haven't done any steps to check for Disability income other than the basic search on the SSA site. 

I know MD is one of those areas where you could easily qualify, but I'm not sure about me currently working. Is there a certain time I HAVE to be unemployed for in order to apply? Is it possible to have a small unemployment period, or does it have to be for 1+ years?",2,1ewiuur,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ewiuur/employee_with_muscular_dystrophy/,1,1724116461.0
The most difficult time of my life is now...,"TLDR: (I'm sorry so long, I'm struggling)

I'm a 44 y/o m, I've struggled with Bipolar Schizoaffective disorder, with acute anxiety, for 12 years (on paper), I'm sure a lot longer. I spent my adult life always living with someone, usually a girlfriend, I was married once. I've been on my own for last 2 years, maintaining everything by myself. 
I live in the city in a small apartment with my cat.

These last 3 months have been probably the most difficult of my life. A whirlwind of negative and anxiety ridden events out of my control have emotionally impacted me one right after another. I feel like it doesn't stop. There's just so much it can't all be said here, would be longer than it already will be. But it started with my last job, I was a clinician at a methadone clinic. Why I decided to take that job, that's just beyond me.
The weeks leading up to my start date, let's just say I was unaware and oblivious as to what was happening to me and my mind. 
I take medication and usually see a therapist if it's affordable or I have insurance, and I've had a very few full-on episodes of my disorders, yet each time it happens, it's always worse than the one before. 
I didn't realize it but my symptoms were beginning to rise to the surface once again as I took on that job. I've been doing clinical work for 7 years. However, I have a long history of being unable to keep a job for an extended time. I hop from job to job, can never be consistent or fully stable. 
I was in permanent SSDI disability from 2013 to 2016. And then when I got sober and stable, I felt I could return to the workforce. I busted my ass for 2 years to attain my Masters Degree in Addiction Psychology. I became a licensed addiction clinician. I think I will always struggle with my own sobriety. And maybe it sounds crazy, but I am very good at talking to and listening to people, hearing their struggles, offering skills for them to learn that I know are effective and that have helped me. 
If you see my profile picture, maybe you'll get the picture more. I've always been one to set myself on the line to help another who needs it, yet struggle to maintain myself.

At work, I was beginning to lose control of some of my behaviors and my very unconventional thoughts were beginning to race slowly out of control. Within the first week of work, I was looking for holes, weaknesses, in the job itself. I guess that's what I tend to do. I probably look for reasons why I shouldn't be there. But after 1 week, I got impulsive and inappropriately raised my issues about the lack of training and structure there to my boss in a long text message.

It was then, when he sat me down in his office, that I briefly divulged to him that I have a mental illness. A disability. From that moment on, I was singled out from the rest, treated opposite of everyone else by the 2 lead supervisors. From berating and intimidating speeches, to embarrassing and hurtful emails, to what seemed like a special set of rules for me to follow that didn't apply to anyone else. Very quickly, I began to spin, and I was oblivious. 

As the days went by, I started dreading the 40 minute drive, my anger rose to the surface and began to take ahold of my moods. My girlfriend at the time eventually told me how very negative I was behaving. I look back she was right. I hated everything and every person. Each day at work brought more anxiety, insecurity, and fear. I had consistent and daily suicidal and homicidal thoughts and feelings.

The constant berating speech my bosses used around me, the unfair way in which they were treating me, left me with a number of strong and destructive feelings. I was very angry. I told myself I needed a gun everyday. I really felt horrible inside, consumed with anger and hate and being at work around them only added fuel to that fire. 

It became clear in my brain that I was being discriminated against by these people. They knew I had a mental health disability and it hurts me to think that the things they did to me, were intentional. 
Eventually I called out of work the last 3 days in a week in June. I had had it, I couldn't stand to be around them any longer, i was spinning,so I took a leave of absence. I thought they would have just fired me. 

I filed for short term disability. Kept up with their documentation requests and had doctor visits. The weeks started going by, and I wasn't getting approved. I fought with them almost everyday and it seemed as though they always needed more information. My poor doctor, he has been throttled with medical forms to submit. In the end, they actually denied me, stating I had a pre existing condition that disqualified me. The denial  letter stated ""a reasonable and prudent person would have sought treatment in that situation.""  
Well, I'm not always reasonable or prudent, I am different than most, I had an episode and i mossed my initial doctors appt, i was exhausted from no sleep. My employers paid my last check and rejected the earned time I had submitted for the hours I missed. That pissed me off too. I hate these people with a very real passion. 

I also wasn't taking care of myself, I drank off an on. My girlfriend decided to break up with me suddenly and I did not cope well at all. Not one bit. 

I was so hurt and miserable I wished everyday that I was dead. 
All those weeks with no income. I was beginning to struggle to maintain my house and bills etc. One day they finally just terminated me, they said I had made a threat against an employee there. But I haven't spoken to anyone there since my last day worked. I'm telling you, these people are so cruel, and they make up their own stories to save their ass. The truth is, they didn't fire me for so long because it would have been wrongful termination for a person with a disability, and I just know that in my gut. So they made up a story. 

Since then, I've been consistently hacked, my phone and laptop, my TV and even my car. It's been going on for a while and I've concluded that someone is either obsessed with me, or they're stalking me and trying to terrorize me. So I disconnected my home internet device, just use the free network in my building. I've reset my phone twice. 

It was uncomfortable at first, But I've stopped giving a shit. If they are really watching me through my devices, then i must be quite an interesting person. And somebody smashed into my parked car and tore the left back end right off. Some random person from FB marketplace who showed interst in an item i was selling, well, i told him i had sold it to someone for a better offer. The next morning he proceeded to harass me via Messenger, saying thay i stole the item i sold out of his truck, and that i stole all his ""equipment"" from the truck too. I was in shock, baffled. Never met the guy, and was a big mystery to me. 
He also seemed to know where I had worked recently, knew about my addiction issues, said he knew my family and where I lived. I called the police and shared with them..
I also responded because I tend to have a big mouth and I've become fearless in the recent month. So I said, if you know where I live then come knock on my door and stop being afraid.

I've been in awe, it's as if the universe hates me. It doesn't stop. But now, I'm dead broke, I can't work, but I don't have a choice so I have to work even when I cant.
I've turned to a criminal lifestyle to make the ends meet. From selling drugs for someone, to a form of check fraud, I feel it's necessary to keep me afloat for now. I don't know what else to do. 

But I'm talking to a lawyer. 
I have nothing to lose anymore, so I'll ride that wagon to the bitter end til I get something back. I don't care, I am not afraid anymore.
I will do anything to survive, and in a world where people abuse me and take from me.

Does anyone have similar experience or advice for what I can do?  I am unsure about working and MetLife told me not to work while I am appealing the disability payments that are due to me. 

My landlord is a very kind man, and he has been generous with me. I will talk to him, but I hate not being able to pay him. I gave him.half of my expensive rent so far, all money earned by illegal means.I can't find an agency in New Hampshire that would assist with my rent unless I get an official eviction notice. 

Any thoughts or advice or anything really is welcome, I appreciate you if you took the time to read this....

My Siblings Say I'm Lazy and Don't Put in Enough Effort,"1st time poster here 34M from Ontario Canada, I've been disabled for the past 4 years due to ICU Polyneuropathy from a bout with Covid(Covid based Pneumonia leading to Multi Organ Failure)(was in a medically induced coma for 2 months). I have not fully recovered and knowing the condition I have, being 4 years out, I never will and I've come to peace with that, and mostly understand my limitations. Without going to heavy into details, I have no college degree and no certifications as I went to work right out of college to support the family, so all I have is work experience some of that being a union rep if that counts for something. My siblings think I don't do enough currently to help the family, as they both have dreams of buying a house and going to Western Canada to do it, and my not working wont be enough to support our mother once they are both gone (younger brother moved there 2 months ago and my sister who has 3 kids moved back in so she could save to move there in a year. They gave my mother and I an ultimatum move there too, or be left here alone and try to make ends meet when they are gone. I want to work, but I have no stamina, need walker/cane to get around, my feet in certain areas feel nothing not even pain(had venous ulcers that only recently healed cause of this), have severe sleep apnea( iirc my AHI was 120), im still weak for someone my age the list goes on. I feel like im making excuses, but Im not sure im being gas lit or lazy. I cried bitterly after a call with my brother when he told me that 4 years ago when I was in ICU and he saw me, what he meant when he said Its time to look after myself, was not that I should focus on healing and getting well, he said it cause he wanted me to get back in to work asap and take some classes get a 2nd job so we can start making some money to make ""moves"". This didn't feel any better after my sister called be big fat and useless and disabled. I genuinely felt like it would have been better I died from Covid they'd have at least gotten some insurance from me, what hurt the most is when my brother said he forced himself to move earlier than he wanted to cause of my condition, he coulndt take coming home from work knowing I just sit at home all day. Im currently on ODSP and every doctor I've been to says I should just focus on recovery, but I know there are those who work while disabled so Im not sure if its me my doctors of them.

Using ABLE account to pay off credit card,"My family and I have been working on another room in the house so I can move into a better room that's more accessible for me, and we've finally gotten to the point where I can start buying new furniture for it.
I'm on SSI and have an ABLE account, and I was trying to figure out if I'd be allowed to purchase the furniture on my credit card, then withdraw the amount of those purchases from my ABLE account to pay it off.
If I do this, would I have to call SSI to make sure they know it was money from my ABLE account? Withdrawing the total amount of the furniture I was looking at won't put me over the $2k limit, I was just worried they'd only see an increase in my main bank account and assume it was income.

"As a visually-impaired adult, I hate being grabbed randomly by someone, dragged away to wherever in the dark, and that same person acts like they did me a favor.","They wouldn't like it if they were unable to see, then a hand grabs your arm and pulls without anyone telling you who they are, and starts pulling you away to some direction. 

It's utterly terrifying, demeaning, and can seriously injure someone.

How hard is it to say, ""Hey, this is _____, can I guide you to [XYZ]?""

What I HATE most about these people is that they think they're doing you a favor and act like you're an inanimate object like a piece of furniture. 

How would they like it if someone did it to them? And when you resist, get mad, and communicate which they clearly feel like they're too good to do, they act like we're that bad guy. They act like we don't know what's best for ourselves and don't deserve the dignity of expressing how best to help us. 

I once saw a blind woman at a networking event for blind and visually-impaired fresh grads, with her boyfriend. We were all going somewhere and instead of telling her what was going on and getting her consent as I've described, he just yanks her across causing her to roll her ankle on her heels and spill her drink. And the idiot goes, ""Oh whoops, be careful. We're going to the auditorium now."" I walked up and tried to tell him that wasn't okay because she was clearly too shocked to say something. 

And this idiot starts trying to rationalize what he did, up until her father came and controlled the situation. I texted her later that evening on social media and she told me her boyfriend apologized. 

I hope she's okay and that guy learned better (I'm doubtful because that took a lot of audacity and ignorance to do). But this issue is one of the many aspects of ableism that I hate having to deal with. 

The worst part of being disabled to me is not just the disability - it's the removal of our dignity and autonomy by a society that sees us as less than human. Because we don't fit their standard of what a normal human being looks like, we are to be treated like broken objects as though we don't still have a place in this world.

Could I use the disabled toilets?,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit but I can't think of anywhere else to ask this)

Hey so, I have ADHD, and suspected autism, and sometimes I can't bare being inside closed tight spaces. I usually stay away from public toilets in those situations because I don't know if I am allowed to use the disabled toilets and I can't bring myself to go inside the small stalls. This only happens occasionally so can go inside normal stalls usually. 

I am looking for advise if it's okay to use them in those situations. Especially since I've heard stories of people getting harassed because they don't look ""disabled enough"" (stupid af I have to say). 

I feel pretty self conscious about myself because of my late diagnosis, I have been masking a long time and when I tell someone I have diagnosed ADHD, they sometimes don't believe me because I'm ""not hyperactive enough"" when I'm more towards the inattentive type (it's a mix of both but leaning towards inattentive).

This is a bit long so, sorry about that, I may have gotten off point a bit",0,1ewhf5h,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ewhf5h/could_i_use_the_disabled_toilets/,6,1724112514.0
I can’t afford anything and I have to work,"I live in ireland. If you’re eligible for disability allowance you get €232 ($256) a week, so €928 ($1024) per month. The thing is, the average rent here is €1500 ($1656) a month. Anything cheaper than that is either a room share or a crappy house in the middle of nowhere and you would definitely need a car.

I’ve applied for disability, they rejected it. I appealed, but that takes a minimum of 18 weeks for them to process it. I’ve been living on my fiancées disability allowance. €232 for 2 people doesn’t get you far at all, especially with medical costs.

So, I have to get a job. I can barely move some days, but I can’t afford this. I’ve had more responses from in person jobs than remote jobs, despite having a high paying remote job before my disability.

Need help finding a hobby for my gpa,"My grandpa is disabled. He's in his 80s and is a bit slower these days (still gets up at 5 am lol).

I'm looking to get him into a hobby. My mom and Uncle want him to retire soon, but he thinks all he has is sitting in front of the TV and watching the ""news"" and sports. I also saw some posts where people were saying that their parents getting REALLY into wordle or BTS got them out of Qanon BS (not joking).

I'd like something that can be done while partially blind & deaf, preferably a social activity. He's also a very matcho, ""I'll sleep when I'm dead,"" type. All suggestions are appreciated. Thank You!

Toilet Seats,"Ok, so my condition involves both dystonia and spasticity, and I am ambulatory, for now. 

When I sit down on a toilet, the force is often not directed straight down. While I am *on* the toilet, my legs apply lateral force to the toilet seat that -- at the very least -- loosens the toilet bolts over time.

I've tried myriad different toilet seats, including ones with special non-slip bumpers, but it feels like it's always inevitable. I've thought about adding something sticky between the seat and bowl, at the bolt, but I then worry about bacteria.

"DNC to be the ""Most Accessible Convention""","The DNC has several stories running about it being the ""most accessible convention ever"". I would like to draw attention to the *obvious* need to expand and update what accessibility has been like to experience and where it has fallen short, and that is being generous. You have things like physical accessibility that address the needs of those with physical disabilities like major fixes to our cities infrastructure: ramps, working elevators in the L, etc. These are **VITAL** and 100% make the pleasures of Chicago accessible in that sense, *and* making these changes, especially as an addendum can be expensive. Where the DNC and organizers fell short is on is putting thought into **sensory accessibility** for those who are blind, deaf, and/or deal with other sensory processing challenges, and **cognitive accessibility** for those of us, like myself, who are autistic and may need information presented in a different format or more detailed than for the general public. Cognitive accessibility is often overlooked, can often have free/cheap solutions, provide clearer communication for everyone, and truly make events like the DNC closer to universal inclusivity. The DNC **needs to be honest** about this and make sure to have more forethought and prioritize the opinion of those *who rely on access* as opposed to those who design but don't utilize.

Not coming from a place of malice, but rather a place of disappointment? Long story short I signed up to be a volunteer in a clearance security role because of my military background. I was signed up for 2 shifts at MP and 2 at UC. I went through the process and sent some emails out regarding issues I was having navigating the process and some questions on various accommodations because I am autistic and keep kosher, etc. in addition to logistical things like my background check, perimeter because I bike, etc. I have sent literally numerous numerous emails to various people all within the DNC and no one is even responding with a status, I'm just being ignored. Asked questions in the zoom training - every question before and after mine were answered, or acknowledged, mine were ignored. Asked in the chat.. ignored. Sent an email after the zoom, which was answered by the head of accessibility apologizing for the experience I've had, asking me for clarification, and ensuring it's being taken seriously. I responded and have heard nothing, radio silence, since that day.",6,1evu6nb,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1evu6nb/dnc_to_be_the_most_accessible_convention/,2,1724045893.0
Do I have a case if I file a complaint?,"I have a depression and anxiety. I work at a corporate as a software engineer in NY, working remotely. I've been having a strained relationship with my manager, who failed to file for my promotion during the last cycle despite my bringing up every week for a month. 

After this happened, I felt he was upset at me because this did not look good on him in my organization. Also, I wonder if this negligence was because of his preference for certain personality even though I am objectively a high performer and he agrees. An example of his behaviors/words that make me this is, on our weekly one-on-one meeting once, he got upset and complained that, whenever he asks me how I'm doing, I never say ""great."" I guess I never feel great so I would just say ""ok."" 

There have been other occasions that I felt he treated me unfairly, although on those occasions the reason wasn't directly my mood or personality. I think he generally prefers more outgoing people who talk a lot and bubbly.

I've talked about this with my therapist extensively, and my depression and anxiety has been a lot worse lately. Is there anything I can do about it?

I have suicidal tendencies and self harm diagnosed  bpd anxiety eating disorder major depressive disorder and adhd. I’ve been diagnosed with adhd since I was a child and the rest I’ve always had but not diagnosed until I went to the local behavioral unit. I’ve been to my local behavioral unit two times because the first time they put “substance induced psychosis” which I was a drug addict yes however I wanted to kill myself because I was depressed over a relationship that tore me apart not because I was under psychosis anyways the next time I went the hospital put “Recurrent episode of depression” which it was and I wanted to kill myself once again. Then the third time I went to a behavioral unit in another state because of my ex it was a nightmare and they diagnosed me with ptsd too but there’s no recollection of that like what!!! I always searched for jobs nothing ever fit right my anxiety makes me stay inside all day sometimes I think I have schizophrenia my thoughts and voices of others never shut up people think I’m crazy and I am however these people will not admit that I am. What do I do? I’m a single mom I can’t even go outside without having a mental breakdown paranoia strikes me everywhere I go even in the house it’s bad. It feels like my whole life is on some type of clock where it just keeps spinning and I never have enough time I never get things right I feel as if I have to save everyone even tho it has nothing to do with me I always feel and even if my life’s in shambles.

He's pretty sweet and nice, but I really feel stressed out that I feel I contribute nothing to our marriage. Because of my condition, I require a caretaker for most of the time.

Work - Autism & Arthritis and Chronic Pain,"I am at a point in my life where I feel I am unemployable and also can't think of what work I can do at home without qualifications or experience in something useful.



I have not worked now since 2019 except for trying a warehouse job for about a week before my Arthritis and chromic pain issues just rendered me unable to do that job. It's annoying because I felt mentally pretty good doing that work and it was not taking away many spoons. I just physically couldn't keep doing the work.



My previous work was within digital marketing, but I don't actually have qualifications in it, the world has moved on massively since I last worked in that sector and frankly the work involved too much social skills that I don't really have, and I don't have the social energy because of being Autistic.

  
I do not have a degree and my a-levels are not in anything useful really... things like Fine Art. 

  
I am kind of panicking now as I am nearly 40 and can't really think of any job I could be employed to do (and cope with!) or anything I can do from home! Yet I need money. Is anyone else in a similar situation? How on earth do I think of something I can do work wise? I don't even know where to begin processing all of this anymore, I just go blank.

my grandma marked me as having a disability when i went to the doctor ,"like the title says my grandma marked me down as having a disability when i went to the doctor the other day and it made me think.. i know having scoliosis CAN be considered a disability if severe enough (my scoliosis did limit my ability to do everyday things) but i had spinal fusion and i guess i just kinda thought that was the end of things but now things are bad and i seem to be limited even more than before (as in i cant even really fall asleep and i wake up in pain) so i guess i dont really know anymore.. for reference i had two 70° curves and i was fused from T2 to L3 in january 2024

while my grandma marked me down as having a disability for scoliosis i also have generalized anxiety, social anxiety and depression (all diagnosed and have been treated with therapy and medication, nothing was helpful.) all of these also limit my ability to do everyday things as well, if not more than my scoliosis did. 

my question is could i really be disabled? i just never really thought about it honestly and im just confused right now.. i've been trying to do research before asking about this but i just need some help honestly 

i feel kinda silly talking about this but i guess im just really confused. if anyone needs more information about anything to try and help me a little im willing to give more, just ask :)

"How do I come in terms with my disability, alone.","I'm 26, deaf/hard of hearing with a cochlear implant and a hearing aid and diagnosed with inattentive ADHD/Autism. I only had them for about than 16 months. Been deaf on one side my whole life and my other side bailed on me last year (sudden hearing loss). Probably being single sided deaf made me grow up like this, indoorsy introvert who is not sociable at all awkward around people and ""weak"" personality (probably as a result).

For the past year with the cochlear ear being a struggle for me, and frankly the hearing aid is not anything like the natural hearing. That in addition to me traveling abroad to study has made me miserable. Also in the same year I was diagnosed with ADHD because I noticed I was going into small depression episodes every now and then mainly it was me being sad when I think about my situation, can't talk smoothly with anyone without asking to repeat themselves, can't stand my cochlear and the noises I hear all the time and the loneliness I experience in this foreign country, where I'm also having trouble to make friends, I was never able to, it's always me being adopted by one or two people and be included in their circles.

  
Almost all the time I feel sad, one time I legit was laying on my bed for 3 days because I watched a video of someone complaining about having to charge their watch every day; mind you, I charge MY 'EARS' twice everyday, and I don't even have the luxury to forget.

  
I know that obviously the answer is to find someone to talk to, vent my feelings. A friend or a partner or anything in between. But the problem is that I can't find any or rather can't make any.

Sorry if my post is long ,"I AM 22 BUT have developmental and intellectual disabilities to the point where I have the mind of a child. I can definitely be taken advantage of, and HAVE been manipulated, specifically my dad, it’s really scary. I’m deemed in need of high support, I can’t get a job, I don’t really have the capability to make choices for myself, I’m basically a kid. How I view the modern world is how a child would, I cant grasp super complicated subjects, i can’t cook, I can’t clean, on top of a whole other bunch of stuff that non disabled people take for granted, I like cartoons, I have meltdowns, I like Lego, toys, comic books, sweets (although nowadays watching cartoons are becoming less and less of a niche I've noticed) I live with my mother who i'd be lost without, im asexual so i don't even WANT to partake in those types of acts with anyone. However mind you, little kids can get crushes too, their just different from adult or even teenage crushes, my first crush was a girl I knew on my street when I was 8, the reason I liked her was because we both liked Lego. It certainly wasn’t sexual or anything like that, it was just a crush I didn’t understand. Even now when I have a crush on someone it’s always in a very non sexual childlike way, I just wanna play with Lego and watch movies and be their for each other. I hate that autism to some people is just “special interest hehe quirky” when their exists autistic people who’s life are ACTUALLY negatively affected by it. I've seen some kids learn something as a 12 year old but i cant even begin to comprehend it, My father alienated everyone in his family because of his hatred for his mother and he treated her in a disgusting manner, normalising the abuse super early on. Not to mention my Christian school would target me for bullying and targeted harassment because they knew I was too timid to tell giving me life long trauma, then had the gull to try and kick me out so they didn’t have to deal with me, which my father blamed me for, it took me years to realise everything that happened to me wasn't a normal thing that's just supposed to happen, Yeah I had my nana who always cared and mom who did her best with her crappy circumstances so I at least had some resemblance of a support system.

My father abused me my entire life, When time when i was a small child he punched his hand because I held onto his ankle, his kept punching it hard until I let go. When i was a toddler my dad was angry that my mum dared to go out for 1 night and leave him in charge, i was about 2 or 3 and i threw up all over myself, he refused to clean me out of spite.

On one occasion my dad strangled me when he was angry i was struggling to go a bike, afterwards he told me i wasn't his son, this really hurt because i was a really sensitive boy who often preferred my mum, which he was severely jealous of and try to cause a rift between us by spreading rumours that she wasn't taking care of me enough (my mum cleaned his little flat and gave him food because he couldn't do anything for himself)

One time my dad threw me into the street late at night and made me walk all the way home when I was about 8 or 9, no regard for my safety, the reason, we argued over a video game, yes I'm completely serious.

When i was even younger, his extended family would take family trips to a pebbled beach, and he walked me out to really deep water and left me their, on my own, neck deep in water keeping my balance, and walked away leaving me to walk back on my own terrified, i guess it was his idea of a joke but we never talked about it again.

Want to go even younger? when i was a FETUS my dad threw keys at my mother when she was pregnant with me, he insisted on getting both of their names on the house recently rented out, but thankfully my mother didn’t let him get his way on that, otherwise I’m certain he would’ve taken the family home and never let it go.

He wasn’t present at my autism diagnosis and argued when i was diagnosed.

He never helped out with Christmas presents, soon after I turned 18 I got so sick of his controlling attitude and cut him off, and recently he ignored my 21st birthday completely, he sent a card that was some online generic card with no thought or effort put into it, he didn’t care.

He went on to start a brand new family to replace me.",1,1evtpds,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1evtpds/sorry_if_my_post_is_long/,1,1724044031.0
To the girl who SNIFFED me today:,"I hate you. We’re the same age but I feel years ahead of you. You decided to make me feel small in front of your friends because you wanted to impress the boy you were with. Your badly highlighted blonde hair and wonky teeth are burned into my mind. I walk with a cane, it’s painful to walk , and it takes a hell of a lot of effort. So yeah , in the middle of a hot day I’m gonna look sweaty. I heard you giggling about my armpit hair , calling me weird. I can’t lift my arms above my head to shave them. One day you’ll grow up , and your body will ache like mine already does, and I hope the world is kinder to you than you were to me. 

Today was the first time I visited a store in months. I’ve been stuck in bed , or a chair , or fixing my wet room plumbing , and haven’t done anything for myself in all that time , and you were disgusting.

The double standard of disability buses,"You'll see old people with disabled bus cards also using the public buses.

Yet, because I'm young and ""only"" mentally disabled, there's more pressure on me to only use the public buses. I have autism, severe OCD, and I have ADHD.

Apparently, I was only allowed to use this service for 1 year. I gotta go in for my assessment to be able to continue using this bus. If I was an old person, I wouldn't need to do this.

There are very few places I know how to get to on the public buses. Even then, the public buses trigger the dangerous urges/compulsions that come with having severe OCD. I seriously have a bad case of OCD induced by trauma. I even get episodes where my compulsions are worse. 

In general, I cannot handle being around big crowds of people because of how bad my case is. Plus, is it fair to expect a disabled person to use uncomfortable public bussing when it's not even totally safe? Accidents have happened with those buses and nobody has seatbelts.

Plus, I'm literally entering a work program for disabled people because regular jobs are difficult.",7,1evddnk,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1evddnk/the_double_standard_of_disability_buses/,6,1723998511.0
"Being ABLE to work hard is a privilege which the average (able-bodied) person isn't aware of    
","Before you come @ me about how it's a privilege to be able to not work (and I agree that there are certainly many circumstances where this is the case) please hear my perspective out...

I have been on both spectrums of being physically healthy/able-bodied, and being extremely chronically ill/disabled. When I was younger, I was an athlete (working out 5-6 days a week, 2-3hrs/day), able to do school full-time, and get straight-A's, and had multiple jobs. Basically, I was a type-A extremely hard-working, productive, and efficient member of society.

When I developed multiple chronic illnesses and health conditions in my early 20's, I went from being a superwoman who could do it all to basically completely bedridden. For a period of time my hands were disabled, I had 10/10 pain throughout my body 24/7, searing migraines, and I was physically incapable of walking. Needless to say, I could not work *any* type of job (blue-collared, white-collared, or otherwise) in that condition. At the worst of my health problems, it was literally impossible for me to work and I did end up living in my car for a period of time (in the beginning my family didn't believe my chronic illness was real and kicked me out because they thought I was mentally ill/lazy). Even jobs that could be done 100% online (which are already extremely limited for many career paths, particularly 10 years ago when I was in my 20's) were not possible for me due to the hand paralysis, migraines, and extreme neurological conditions (including light sensitivity to screens and very bad cognitive issues/brain fog).

After being told it's all in my head and that I'm just lazy/don't want to work (despite me being an extremely hard-working person for my entire life prior to my diagnosis) by virtually all of society, almost a decade later I finally have several diagnoses that validate my disabilities. I am also fortunate to have improved to some degree where I can still work (but not nearly to the extent that I used to be able to) with certain accommodations but I am still very limited by severe chronic pain and daily symptoms. I had to chance my entire career path and life around my disability, because the path I was taking was simply not accessible to me.

My chronic illness/disabilities essentially ruined my 20's, destroyed my bank account (medical bills leaving me with no savings, so I am nowhere near being able to save for things like a home or retirement). Coming from this perspective, it irks me sometimes when people deny that health/ability privilege is a real thing and act as if they do not have privilege to be able to work. I understand the plight of the lower-class/middle-class working person who needs to work very hard, sometimes in multiple jobs, to have a roof over their head and put food on the table. But for some people with severe disabilities/chronic illnesses, no matter how hard they want to or try, this is quite literally not possible or accessible. Many of those people end up losing everything and becoming homeless, then being further blamed and stigmatized for their situation.",221,1eusksw,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eusksw/being_able_to_work_hard_is_a_privilege_which_the/,30,1723930229.0

CPP Disability Reassessment,"My partner has been on CPP Disability Benefit for last several years. He recently received bunch of questionnaire and forms to fill out as part of Disability Reassment after he had notified Service Canada that he returned to a workforce.

What happens if he indicates he does not give his consent to Service Canada to collect medical and personal information about him from third parties?

Entering the Work Force and Frustrated ,"I am graduating in December, but I only have one class this semester and the communication portion of my degree is finished, and career services at my university said I should try to start applying and getting interviews at least.

I agreed, I just lost my SSI benefits for saving student loan refunds to help pay for school, and I just want to be done and move on. I tried freelancing, but it’s not going well. 

It’s frustrating, because I am qualified. I have a portfolio with quality work from my time in communication and journalism classes, but it’s never enough. I feel like not matter how qualified I am, I’m just not getting a shot. 

I even had to change my major from journalism to communication, because journalism required an internship. Issue was, I couldn’t get one no matter how many I applied for. My advisor even said she had seen less qualified students have no issue getting an internship.

I’ve sat down with career services and worked with them to make a quality portfolio, resume, cover letter, everything. However, still, just not enough.

I just want to try and put some money towards getting a new home. How long would I be able to work and still keep my benefits? I could probably do a few months before I would have to leave.

Stage IV cancer disability benefits,"I’m not sure if this belongs here or in a legal sub? But I’m in WA state. In 2013 I was diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer that metasized to my liver. I had many rounds of chemo, radiation, and surgeries that removed most of liver, feet of intestines, and my rectum. I had a colostomy bag for a year and was able to have it reversed. During that time we did not even consider disability benefits or anything besides fighting this and surviving and lived off of my wife’s very low income and student loans. We went into and remain to this day, very much in debt. 

My question is - looking back, am I able to now file for long term disability - I have been cleared of the cancer and “no evidence of disease” but the effects of the aforementioned treatment and surgery render me unable to hold a job. Without too much detail, for the first 6-7 years I could not leave the house for more than 30-60 minutes and tried as I might to hold a job, running to the bathroom in meetings or even as a salesman or bartender made it impossible to stay employed. Even now (in the past 2-3 years) I can leave for a few hours and have been better at controlling things, but not for long periods of time and sometimes get so constipated still my stomach becomes a beach ball and I’m doubled over in pain unable to move. 

I guess I wasn’t sure if there was a statute of limitations or how I even prove this or what can be done - it just crossed my mind as a family friend was told he had a disability and he’s trying to figure out the system now. My wife is still chugging along and supporting us without complaint for the last decade and I’m not sure if this would help us not live paycheck to paycheck (and I’m almost 60 so the other fear unlocked is she will never be able to retire since I’ll never be able to contribute financially, never mind save for retirement). And for the record I keep trying to get a job but if there are days on end with me running to the bathroom every 3-5 minutes, it just doesn’t last. and the feeling of my body failing me and me failing my wife just breaks my heart.

inaccessibility is a wild thing,"Something I've noticed about my city... and island in general, is that it's inaccessible as fuck. Like, so inaccessible even non-disabled people struggle to walk around💀
I live on this small rock in the southeast of Madagascar. We're pretty damn poor over there, and the terrain isn't exactly easy to navigate if there isn't a huge work of leveling it up done which is expensive and harmful to nature- sidewalks are narrow and broken, roads are full of potholes in most parts, and the very large majority of the cities are built on hills and steep terrain.

Working and need to know rights ,"I’m working.  I am disabled.  I push myself to work.  I love the work I do.  Unfortunately like many of you I have dr appts frequently.  This November will be 2 years at my job.  In April I was hospitalized.   A couple of weeks later my husband was.  He isn’t disabled it just happened to be near when I had been.  I had not disclosed and I do have an invisible disability.  Two weeks after my husband’s hospitalization the division CEO and my supervisor called me via video to let me know that 3 out of the last 12 pay periods were under 80 hours.  Our handbook makes no mention of this being a problem.  She says because of this I would be considered part time.  However, there are no part time positions.  This is when I disclosed.  I said I’m always going to have Dr appts and I had not been hospitalized for years.  She said I would have to use intermittent FMLA for my Dr appts.  To back up a little - before this I would get in trouble for working too late. I normally had Dr appointments but would more than make up my time. I ran out of PTO at this time also. After talking to HR I was told not to worry about it. But I did have to have Dr excuses.  Only me, no one else in our division does.  A couple of weeks later I had my one on one with my COO and my supervisor. This was of course brought up. I explained I did not have to use FMLA but would use ADA leave.The next week I found out that I had to have wrist surgery. I was going to only take 1 week off but since they pushed about FMLA I filed and my surgeon said 8-12 weeks off. I wound up taking 8. During this time I was told our division was changed to 4 - 10'S and I was given Fridays off we were encouraged to make dr appointments on our off day. Unfortunately many of my drs do not see patients on Friday. First week back I had an appointment on Thursday. On Wednesday I worked thru lunch because I don't have PTO. My COO calls me on Thursday AM to tell me I can't work thru lunch.Because that is no longer allowed.  He asked me to manipulate my time to show a lunch and then I could just make up time on Friday. He also said I have to have 40 hours even though I don't have PTO, on Friday I made up my time plus 1 hour.in manipulating my time I forgot to account for that hour and lost one hour of OT. The next week I had an appointment on Monday. I was out of office for 3 hours. I try to stay late to make up time but my supervisor calls to tell me I have to go home. I had to have 40 hours.  I explained i had no PTO and I had to stay late to get the required 40. Was told no, have to go home. I did stay 30 min over. I took short lunches also. By the end of the week I only owed half an hour. Popped in on Friday and worked it. This is the abbreviated version.

My questions:

1. Can they require doctor excuses?
2.can they require me to work 40 hours when the only time I am missing is for doctor appointments related to my disability?


There is much more that I have left off.  Feel free to ask questions and thank you

It can last just a morning- or it can last 3 weeks. It makes it painful to fully stretch it, if impossible, and often I can’t bend it fully back either.

Recently it seems something else (maybe my kneecap) might be popping out of place too. 
The thing is, I’m told it’s fixable. With physical therapy i should be fine. If it’s too severe, I might need surgery. 

I am autistic and I have accommodations for that already, but I feel like it would be misleading if I started asking for accommodations for my leg as well. I don’t know if I should get a cane- as I’ll only need it once every three months- if that.

Travelled with someone who did not take my disability seriously ,"Hello! I recently went on a 1-week trip with someone I thought was my friend. I have endometriosis, which is considered a disability for me, and some other mental issues that don't really matter in this story.

I told her multiple times before leaving that I wouldn't be able to walk fast or do certain things. She said it was fine. 
Once there, she kept complaining that I wasn't walking fast enough. I told her that I couldn't, she apologised, but she did it again the next days. 
We had a huge fight in front of the Cologne Cathedral because I was taking a break, too long for her (3 minutes). I was having an endo flare-up. The pain feels like birthing a child. 
Anyway! I left her to go back to the hotel, and once she arrived, I told her I was leaving her to stay with my German friend. 
At first, she acted as if nothing ever happened, but then she kept apologising with tears, she somehow managed to say it was my fault and that I shouldn't let that ruin the trip. 
She probably thought she would get away with it again. I'm a patient and honest person, when something is wrong, I explain it to people calmly. But I was so angry that I screamed at her. 

After staying with my German friend, I had to go to the last hotel.. with her. I tried to understand why she did not take me seriously. 
She replied with a bunch of selfish arguments, saying it's her way of thinking blablabla... 

She also told me a few months before that I should be ashamed of getting a disability allowance cause people have worse... I feel so ashamed that I was friend with that girl for 14 years. I always thought she was being brainwashed by her parents, so each times I would explain to her that she was wrong. And I thought she understood, but apparently not.

Wrist disability after work injury. Might get fired because of it. Has anyone been fired from a long term job because of on the job injury?,"Long story short, I got injured at work and it never healed properly/workmans comp is blaming it on family history. My doctor released me to normal duties even though I have pain. HR is now involved and wants to know what accommodations are needed. Talked about the ADA and how they could see if there is a better position for me but ""they aren't required to make me a spot"". So hint at firing me? I keep hoping it will get better. Maybe with a few days off to rest which I never got during workmans comp. Hoping I can have accommodations that my job will be okay with but it's production work so it's doubtful. All I use is my hands at work, doing small tasks. My 4 year anniversary is coming up, same with my birthday. So we will see if they decide to pull a really nasty move.

Not allowed to use the restroom ,"Our little girl was born with complex craniosynostosis. She also has mild to moderate autism, which is probably related to the cranio. All of the growth plates in her skull were closed at birth, and she's had two surgeries for this condition and will have her third surgery next month, along with a surgery on the bone structure and muscles around her eyes. She is potty-trained and has been for a while. However, she doesn't always have a lot of notice before she needs to visit the restroom. She rides the school bus, which is one of the highlights of her day. However, the ride lasts about 45 minutes, and once they arrive at the school, they must wait 10 - 15 minutes before they're allowed to disembark. Last week, she had to use the restroom so badly when she arrived at school that the bus driver got one of the school staff members to let her use the restroom and return to the bus. We're now being told that she'll never be allowed in the school to use the restroom again before the busses unload because having one of the staff interact with the students at that time of day is a union violation. I know that this situation will occur again, and she'll end up wetting her pants. I believe that this is an ADA violation for failure to make reasonable accommodations. Still, I would like to find out if anyone else has had a similar situation and how they resolved it.

Don't buy items >$1k from Amazon with Third Party Fulfillment ,"How this affects our community is at the end.

I bought a laptop for ~$2k, but didn't know the risks involved with such an expensive purchase when using Amazon's Third Party Fulfilment. I bought it at the end of May and after being told by the company that they'd rather give me a refund than a working device (seriously), I agreed to take a refund at the end of June. I had their defective merchandise in the mail within a few hours only to be told that they wanted to inspect their junk before returning my money. Which to this day, they never have.

Since then I have spoken with around 10 different Amazon representatives to try to get my money back. I had people who tried to help, claimed to try, outright lied about taking steps they never did, a couple who ended chats prematurely, and some who just transferred me as soon as they understood that my issues went beyond their control. Apparently Amazon is ok with third party sellers scamming people on their website if they know how to game the system and now I've learned that they really don't want to help the disabled either!

After this going on for almost two months and severely damaging my personal business both monetarily and in reputation since I couldn't fulfill some orders, I have started asking for managers. (I know I'm a pushover on this stuff, I'm working on it.) The supervisor I spoke to last week claimed he was submitting a request to his supervisors to look into it and repeatedly assured me he'd be surprised if I didn't get my money back, but obviously that didn't happen. In fact, one I spoke to today informed me that they didn't submit anything. I asked to speak to their supervisors since the second tier of Amazon Customer Service can only authorize refunds up to $1k. That is when they said that I could set up a call back, but the tier after them doesn't engage in text chats.

I cannot hold up a phone for too long without some serious pain so that is obviously not going to work for me and I informed them of that. At that point, they started evading my questions even more and refused to explain why their supervisors couldn't accommodate my disability or what they'd do if I were deaf. They eventually ended the chat without a word and sent me to someone who stonewalled and sent ridiculous platitudes while avoiding my questions before selecting a resolution where they politely ask the scammers for my money back without telling me how to painlessly talk to people with the authority to do something.

So now I'm here warning all of you that not only will Amazon help scammers who sell defective merchandise keep your money almost two months after receiving their crap back with ridiculously illogical protocols (ex. The value of items being too high to authorize and the request for my money had to be restarted because they lied about intending to return it instead of ignoring the request), but they will offer no reasonable accommodations for your disabilities if you have trouble with phone calls.",0,1euyaj2,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1euyaj2/dont_buy_items_1k_from_amazon_with_third_party/,13,1723946857.0
Dealing with Inspiration Porn?,"One of my teacher was talking about how she wanted this years theme to be determination and no excuses. Ok thats fine, the typical beginning of year stuff. Then she started talking about this man she met who biked 60 miles on harsh terrain with only one arm and one leg. Don't get me wrong, thats extremely impressive and inspiring, but then. She gets so emotional about it that she starts CRYING. I'm sitting there like. This is weird. She continues to bring up various accomplished disabled people and ends up close to full on bawling bc she's so inspired.

She ends finishes her speech out with a ""You know these people are getting up everyday and doing amazing things. They don't complain or feel sorry for themselves. You should be able to get through your math classes"" which like. ehhhhhhhhhhh.  We all just sit there awkwardly because?? what else are we supposed to do??  Several other students (including myself) are disabled which really just makes it awkward. 

How do you handle this? I have a feeling it might happen again (this is not my first class with her and this type of thing has appeared before)(not quite as bad though)



TLDR: my teacher keeps showing us accomplished disabled people, getting so emotional about it she cries, then says we have no excuses. considering several classmates (as well as myself) are disabled its very weird and awkward.

Things that still amaze me after leaving my adult group/foster home ,"I have the ability to make my own medical decisions based on my needs, how I feel, my wants and my diagnosis. No one is avoiding taking me to the doctor or ER just because I don’t seem bad enough. I hide pain and illnesses as a trauma response… I never look as bad as I actually feel…

I can come and go as I please

I can spend my money as I want to

I don’t have to live with roomates who scare me half to death with their behavior (not all of them were that bad but staff never did much about the ones who were)

No toxic staff gaslighting, blaming, judging and making assumptions about 

I have the ability to choose to stop meds if the side effects are too much or I just rather take something else

I have the ability to choose a non-medicated or minimally medicated treatment plan 

I can get resources and career opportunities without a process that takes so long that I completely lose the opportunity

If I feel threatened or get hurt and it’s bad enough to get the police involved I can do so without wasting precious time on a process

If I need to go to the ER I can do so immediately instead of wasting time on another harmful process

I’m able to learn valuable life skills now because I have free access to my entire home now. Clients weren’t allowed to cook at all the foster/group homes I was in 

I can get a pet when I’m ready

I can keep most of my SSI (rent in those homes is all but like $200 of your SSI)

I can put my phone in DND without getting in trouble 

I’m not treated like a child anymore and I’m not put Into situations I’m definitely not able to cope with just because someone else doesn’t actually care about what’s best for me but wants to seem like they do

No more unfair power dynamics at home

I can lock my bedroom door

I can do things on my own time

Do you believe my mother could be accepted for disability based on her medical history?,"I believe she applied when she had breast cancer when I was underage and was denied.  I wasn’t of age to be more involved to know about why she was denied. 

Today, she is 63. Has years of history of depression. She’s been on anti depressants for years. Gets off, and soon after needs to get back on.  Now that I am older, I can tell when she’s been off of them because she has paranoia and feels like a burden to everyone.  Has had suicidal ideation that she’s never mentioned to the doctors but has opened up to me about it. That is one of her diagnoses. 

Second being her GI issues that she cannot find a solution for.  The doc prescribed her so many things for diarrhea. She travels with a portable toilet.  Wears diapers sometimes when she knows there might not be a bathroom nearby.  Has had several colonoscopies. More than the recommended amounts for her age. 

Only reason I am looking into this now after all these years is because they financially need it. They have always been low income but with the inflation these days (California) things are getting rough for them.  I help where I can but I am in school. My dad is 63 and does not plan to retire until 66 or 67 to get a better amount.  My mom cannot retire because she is short two credits for social security.

Should I ask my doctor about mobility,"It hurts when I stand still for more than 5 minutes because of my double jointed legs. So when my legs are in their natural position my knees bend the other way which actually ends up hurting my legs unless I force my legs to bend normally. 

I have asthma and a heart condition that makes my chest hurt when i jog more than one or two laps in school. its also very common for me to get nausea and I get frequent headaches.

the thing is its not just my feet hurt it’s my back and my neck to that hurts

I’ve thought it was normal to not be able to stand for more than 5 minutes without my knees or my back hurting. But it’s not!

I also like walking so if I were to get a mobility aid it wouldnt be a wheel chair. I feel like having a cane with another mobility aid would be super useful. I can use a cane on one of my amazing days and the other on my less than good ones. (Something like rollater or forearm crutches.)

the only bad thing is I kinda feel like I’m faking it or that I shouldn’t want a Mobililty aid since I’m young or that im not disabled enough.

Question about canes and rolling luggage,"I booked a small holiday before I needed to use canes.

The trip is for 4 days so I need to bring a certain minimum of stuff.  

The canes are for widespread osteoarthritis that has led to sciatica. My condition degenerated so I could only walk a few metres at a time and couldn't get into work. The canes seem to work so far.

"'Learning to come to terms with my newly broken body.' Or 'it's amerika, st*pid'","I had a good cry this morning. (still in the mourning phase I guess) I WAS a dancer for 12 years before 2020. vagovana, RAD, cecchetti style ballet. not pro, but serious enough that it was integral to who I was. en pointe for over a decade. and then BLAM! 2020 happened, and then the lockdowns. I went from 5-6 hour days at the barre to stuck at home. seems to be where it all started.   
what began with a twinge in my lower back eventually became a full on disability in my lumbar and sacrum.   
i can't stand for more than ten minutes at a time. can't sit, can't walk without a cane, and for more than half an hour. I need lay-down breaks throughout the day. the pain is excruciating. i feel something clunking and popping, and when I do my old stretches, my husband can hear it from across the room. 

it's been like this for a couple years now. getting progressively worse. 

when I married my husband this last February, I got on his insurance. it's good insurance since he works at a hospital. but stilll, I am 'not allowed' to get an MRI that the doctor ordered because the insurance denied it, in lieu of 6 months rehab, which seems to be only aggravating my joints in my sacrum, NOT HELPING.   
and without that MRI we are all groping in the dark for answers.

Giving my daughter the gift of the outdoors with my ebike. ,"My 5 year old daughter has quad CP, and I've always wanted to find ways to share my love for the outdoors with her. She lights up whenever we're outside, and I cherish those moments.  A couple of months ago, I had an idea: what if I could modify an e-bike to safely take her on rides with me? I did some research and decided on the Freedare Eden Step-thru. It's sturdy, comfortable, and has plenty of power for two.  Then I got to customization. I added a front-mounted seat, found a sturdy child bike seat designed for mounting on the frame. I welded custom brackets to the front of the e-bike's frame to securely attach the seat. On harnessing I used a five-point harness, similar to what you'd find in a car seat, to keep her secure. I then fabricated adjustable footrests that attach to the bike's frame, so her feet wouldn't dangle. I also added a small plexiglass windscreen to her seat to deflect bugs and wind.

Seeing the smile on her face on our first ride made all the effort worthwhile. We go on rides together now all the time, and it's become one of her favorite things to do. It's amazing how something as simple as feeling the wind in your hair and enjoying the scenery can bring so much joy.

I'd love to hear from other parents or caregivers of children with disabilities. What are some of your favorite activities to do together?

Really struggling and don't know what resources are available to me,"I created an account just to post here. It has been a really rough couple of months for me. I suffer from depression and OCD which have made it hard for me to get, let alone maintain, a job. It took me forever just to get over the initial panic to go to a job and survive the first day. With more time and better understanding of my condition, I have been able to stay longer, but the longest I have been in a job is a year and two months. I either can't get the accommodations I need to function (primarily flexible schedule for my numerous appointments) or the stress I feel from my OCD boils over to the point where I simply can't be in that job any longer.

I quit my last job on the spot due to this. It's been really devastating mentally and financially. It feels like I keep digging myself into a deeper hole. I no longer have insurance, which I desperately need with my appointments and medications. And I can't seem to find a replacement job. I've gotten a handful of interviews where I feel like I've done well but still can't manage to land the actual job. Part of it feels like it's due to my disability. I know that ADA is built upon REASONABLE accommodations, so I try to bring up that I have one, to avoid wasting time for both parties. I don't want to do that, as once again, it feels like I am being dismissed as a candidate due to it. But on the other hand, I don't want to go through the whole onboarding process just to learn I will have to skip out on all my psychiatrist/therapy/doctor appointments in order to keep the job.

Had to cancel on new friends…,"A new friend has a birthday this weekend where the plans have changed like three times. The first (a bar) would have been hard but manageable as I could have left early and not drank, the second (a restaurant) even more doable, the third (a sleepover) absolutely not doable, and the last (small gathering at a persons apartment) was going to be a several hours long affair with drinking and smoking. For context, diagnosed with severe ME/CFS, dysautonomia (IST w/ hypotension), hypermobility (need gene testing still but almost certainly HSD/hEDS), vestibular migraines.

The several hours which included cooking was not at all realistic but I still wanted to go for a couple hours. However, I’m crashing/flaring this week and even lost the ability to walk for awhile the other night. I’m not doing so great with walking even now and am a fall risk. So I asked if I could bring my partner who helps take care of me (which also, wouldn’t even be that odd as someone else’s partner will also be there). 

They cited space in the apartment, so I said that if there wasn’t space for her there certainly wasn’t space for my rollator or for me to lay down to regulate my heartrate if needed. And that I wouldn’t be able to attend. Why tf would I choose to put myself into worse PEM for someone who won’t even let me bring my caretaker or consider my disabilities when planning activities? Or ensure there’s space for me to lay down or use mobility aids. 

I realize I don’t particularly care about burning bridges when they connect to people who can’t or won’t accommodate me. I spent years trying to push through and now I have severe CFS. It’s just not worth it to me. I frankly only want to be friends with other physically disabled or chronically ill people at this point, because it seems like most people who aren’t don’t consider our needs or safety.

before all this allergy nonsense, i was diagnosed with ehlers danlos and postoral orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (EDS and POTS) and was given very little information about both conditions. i don't remember if i specified this or not in my last post but i was only told ""consider losing weight, what are your plans to do that?"" after being given base-line information, by both the specialist who diagnosed me and my PCP. i was not told of any other options like phys therapy and mobility aids (beyond the cane i already had), possible comorbidities that can occur, or even medications that i could take that would alieve my symptoms like propranolol (which i take now).

What are my options?,"I’ll try and make this as condensed as possible:

I’m a 26F in Indiana who was approved for disability a year ago, and first applied 2.5 years ago. In September I’m reaching the limit of being on Medicaid and will be transitioned to Medicare. 

After going through an FSSA interview, I was approved for MAL financial aid. I was not eligible for dual eligibility due to making about $65 too much monthly in disability benefits. So my Medicare premiums and stuff will be covered, but I won’t have dental or vision insurance. 

I have very bad teeth due to the medications I take, so a good dental plan (that I can afford) is crucial. Vision is also important, but less so, as my vision issues are covered under medical. 

First: is there a way I can decrease my monthly disability payments so I can qualify for dual eligibility? I would rather get less monthly than not have insurance. 

Second: if that’s not possible, what are my dental option? What’s the best plan? Are there more financial aid options if I can’t cover the dental insurance costs?

How do you roll over in bed if you can’t move your legs?,"Hi everyone,

My grandmother has a back injury which got worse and worse with time, and doctors were afraid of operating on her because of her age. Today she cannot feel her legs nor move them. Worth noting is that she is also over weight.

She needs help with most types of movement like getting up from bed, laying down or moving around. Most of this is no problem for us, because she is our grandmother and it is our duty to help her all the time.

When sleeping she prefers to sleep on her sides because sleeping on her back is painful. After some hours of sleep she wakes up in the middle of the night and calls us to roll her over because her arm and body get tired from the weight and position. Thereafter she can continue her sleep for another few hours before we receive another call.

I thought I might get some tips from people in this sub that have experienced similar problem or have a solution for rolling over in bed without assistance when having no control over the legs.

What does the community think of the creation of an official (issued by government possibly?) license for service animals?,"For context, I am a disabled person with an emotional support dog but not a service animal and I'm in the US. 

I really hate how many stories I hear about people with actual service animals getting a hard time in day to day life because other people keep bringing their pets/emotional support animals into businesses and claiming they're service animals. I love that there isn't a barrier of having to prove your animal is a service animal right now, but I wonder if it would be worth the trouble to have a program or something to officially license/certify that an animal is in fact a service animal so that all of the people who are abusing the openness of the current system can no longer do so. 

Off the top of my head, I can't really think of a format of identification (ex. ID card, vest, documentation, collar tag, etc.) that couldn't be forged, but like, we have driver's licenses and those get scanned when you buy weed (in states like mine where it's legal) and a fake ID wouldn't work for that (I think?) so couldnt there be some system to do something like that for service animals? 

My instinct is that requiring folks to get a license would likely turn into too much of a barrier to be accessible to the people who need it. But still, I wonder if there isn't some way to make this situation better. 

Thoughts? 

+++++++

EDIT: Thanks for all of the dialogue here, everyone. It's really great to hear from all of you, especially those who are most impacted by this. The gist I'm getting is that it's a fucking pain that people abuse the system but it's much better than making the service inaccessible to people who need it. 

I read one comment that said something like ""I'm happy to see more dogs around if it means people who need service animals get to have them"" and it made me think about how as a dog lover, I generally would love to see more dogs around **if they are well trained enough for the environment.** As a dog parent, I have loads of places I wish I could take my dog with me, but also loads of places that I would never take my dog even if I were allowed to bc I know it would be overwhelming for my dog, me or both of us. I wonder what the world would be like if we just generally allowed more dogs places, with the caveat that they must be well-behaved, leashed, etc.  *and* that pet owners and business owners would actually adhere to that.

I've been considering purchasing a Nintendo Switch, as not having much to do gives me anxiety from overthinking about the future and what could happen to me down the road. But gaming systems are expensive, and although I could make a big purchase, I'm wondering if there's something else I could do from home.

Ambulatory Wheelchair ,"I have a question. I am an 18 year old female born with rheumatoid arthritis that went undiagnosed for 11 years. This caused me to damage my joints severely. Past couple days me and my friends have been going around and doing somethings together before school starts. Two days ago we were walking around the mall and we spent some time doing airsoft. Yesterday we went to the fair. My legs have been killing me. Today we went to a theme park. I decided to ask about using a mobility aid such as a wheelchair because I didn’t think I’d be able to get through the entire day.

I’m questioning if this was right. Because I can walk long distances and stand for long distances but I was using it to spare the pain on my joints. And I got a lot of strange looks. Was I in the wrong? At what point should I be using a wheelchair or other aids? Am I taking a resource away from someone who needs it more? Should I have just walked and dealt with the pain?

ADA Seating?,"Recently I bought ADA Seating for a concert, and I’m wondering if I’m still allowed to sit in those chairs with an invisible disability. 

For reference, I have terrible anxiety, and take both anxiety meds as well as beta blockers to control it, but in situations like concerts, theatres, and airplanes, where I’m in close proximity with many people it often gets a lot worse. In these situations, I get fainting spells, nauseous, and my whole body begins to shake and I can‘t walk or function super well. My therapist told me that ADA seats have extra space as they need to be compatible for wheelchair users and their companions, so it may be a good idea to try an ADA seat as I won‘t be so tightly compact with other people. 

I’m really anxious about this because I have huge fears and anxiety issues about the way that people perceive me, and if you think I’ll be getting dirty looks or questions the whole night I probably just wont go 😭

Even thinking about it makes me want to throw up and die, but I should be going to this concert to get over this fear, so let me know what you guys think. Is it ok for me to use that seat?",3,1etcn1t,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1etcn1t/ada_seating/,15,1723772374.0
How do I learn to live with a disability? ,"I’m 23f and I have a disability known as erbs palsy. Mine was very severe I believe more than one of my nerves were completely ripped from my spinal cord. My affected arm is shorter, atrophied, and basically useless. I can’t use my fingers or wrist at all, straighten my arm, and the highest I can lift it is around my heart. 

Throughout school I would only wear hoodies to hide my arm and pants to hide the two giant scars that go up the back of my calves from a nerve transfer surgery (even in 90 degree weather) I would never talk to anyone because I was and still am scared of people finding out. I would go to the bathroom and burst into tears if I had to do group projects or just skip class. 

They way my arm looks makes me so insecure I still only wear hoodies now even by myself because I can’t look at my arm I’m so ashamed and embarrassed somehow. I shower in the dark, I never look in mirrors. I wish I could wear dresses, tank tops, skirts, anything cute but I feel so hideous. I get so upset when my friend gets to wear cute things but I look like a badass psycho from the game borderlands. My arm is deformed and it makes me feel so unfeminine like I can’t be beautiful because women shouldn’t be flawed. I know I’ll never be conventionally attractive, it shouldn’t bother me but it destroys me because I could of been so pretty. I don’t date because I know men are visual creatures and I know my body is disturbing due to deformities and multiple scars from surgery and self harm. 

Then I have to deal with the fact I’ll never be able to play guitar or any other instrument I’m interested in. Like I wanted to be in a band so bad but I can’t. I can’t play guitar and i have severe panic attacks when I have to do any task in front of people even my best friend I’ve had since kindergarten. Sometimes I hate everyone because they don’t suffer like I do. When I was a kid and would blow out my birthday candles I would wish to be a normal girl and have a normal arm up until I was 11. That’s when I realized it was never going to happen. I took it so seriously to, I wouldn’t tell anyone just because I wanted it to come true so badly and if you wanted your wish to come true you couldn’t tell anyone. 

I’ve seen people with my diss say as they get older they start hanging problems in the non affected arm from using it so much so now I have that to look forward to. I can’t believe this is all I have to look forward to. My body getting more disabled. I just don’t know what to do with my life. My disability and scars make me less desirable and takes away everything I ever wanted for myself. I’m so heartbroken and lost I don’t know how to handle these things. I’m sorry if this is a mess I just need help from people that also struggle I’m a mess.

I’m disabled but undiagnosed & need food- what do I do?,"ETA: I cannot go to the store or a food bank or really anywhere that has cardboard, single-use plastic, or paper as they all contain formaldehyde and will cause me to faint, vomit, or have a seizure in large quantities. I’m also too sick to drive anywhere and don’t have access to public transport. 

I have been very sick for a year now. Thanks to r/Mold, I finally got some help figuring out the cause after the healthcare system repeatedly failed me. I am still waiting to see an immunologist and do not have an official diagnosis yet, but I’m 99% sure that I have Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. 

Long story short, my once mild allergies have become so severe that they are debilitating and I am not able to leave the house much. One of these allergies is formaldehyde, so grocery stores are out of the question. I’m not able to afford food a lot of the time and I have become so underweight that it’s affecting my menstrual cycle. I was a runner before I got sick and in excellent health, and now I can barely keep myself and my small apartment clean, let alone have the energy to do much else. 

How can I get food delivered? I can’t exactly work right now and applying for disability can take years. I’m hungry almost all the time and I’ll never get better if I can’t get nutritious food on a regular basis. I’m in the US and any advice or places to start looking would be appreciated, thank you.

Now, I am a senior in college, and will be graduating in the fall with a degree in communication with a minor in history. I want to go into the advocacy field with my degree, and I’m trying to build a portfolio.

So, I’ve decided to do an advocacy project. I decided experiences of others in VR programs are important to share. If you have a story similar, (especially with Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities) and are willing to share your story, please reach out.

The link is to context of my situation.

I received this response from HR today:

Good morning,
 
We have received your message and we are reviewing the situation. You can expect a response before the end of the month on next steps.
 
As of this point, there is still no accommodation granted, and your schedule will remain as has been designated by (Supervisor) and (Director). If you have concerns in the meantime, please reach out to (Supervisor) or (Director) directly.
 
Thank you!

They were pretty quick to say no the last 2 times so I’m wondering why it’s taking this long to get an answer. I saw that HR and my managers spoke this morning before they sent this email to me so why didn’t they come up with a decision then? I mean I did corner them with the truth and facts so maybe they are going to actually learn about employment disability laws before they answer me. 

Im super nervous because the commute to work is physically making me sick and I don’t want my work to suffer because my employer decided to break the law and cover it up just because my able bodies coworkers want to lay in their pjs all day.

Doctor seems less concerned about my test results than he should be,"I’ve had a series of symptoms the past 3.5 years with little to no answers. I have pretty bad chronic fatigue, some heart issues, random episodes of paralysis, really intense Deja Vu symptoms that include facial numbness and brain fog, brain fog in general, joint pain at night, dizziness and loss of balance… for years I’ve been pushing for tests and referrals to specialists and it’s been really difficult to get doctors to take me seriously (my primary has recently been reminding me that I have a referral for a psychiatrist when I bring up my symptoms). 

Yesterday I had another appointment with my primary and we decided to do more bloodwork and this time my “TSH WITH REFLEX TO FT4” (I copied this from MyChart so apologies if it doesn’t make sense) is 10.7 when the recommended max is 4.5. I was doing research on this and it seems to basically mean I have “overt hypothyroidism”. Doing more research I noticed that almost every single issue I have can be a symptom of this, or associated with thyroid problems. It even is connected to health issues I hadn’t even considered to be related to my thyroid. I’m sure this may seem weird, but I was almost excited about the results because it showed that it’s not all in my head, and when reading up on the treatments I saw that most people who took the medication were relieved of their chronic fatigue issues within a few weeks. 

I just got a note from my doctor that says “Elevated TSH with normal FT4, no med changes at this time but we should continue to monitor thyroid function.” I feel incredibly disappointed, especially because my symptoms are debilitating and I’ve been unemployed for 2 years and am currently applying for disability. I would much rather have my life back than sit around monitoring my thyroid.

I have a question about my wife's disability and I don't really know where to get clear answers. may I ask for some advice?,"My wife has postprandial BM or Dumping syndrome. She can work but needs to be able to access a restroom quickly. She didn't declare that she was disabled when she was hired as her symptoms were not that severe prior to 2022. I want to know what is truly considered disabled in this situation?

Her doctor previously requested for accomodations for access to the restroom and frequent visits to the restroom throughout the day.  She has been diagnosed with postprandial BM and I wanted to know if she needs to file with the state as having a disability so that her employer will not be able to discriminate against her.

I say that because they have placed her on an immediate leave until they receive a clearer explanation of her condition, stating that the doctors note provided to them did not list a reasonable accommodation that was clearly outlined and they were unsure how to comply with her medical needs.

It seems to me that they were just trying to pick on her. My wife just wants this to stop and continue to work. I am currently trying to get a lawyer but we are not wealthy and I don't know where to get more information.

Every place I call the attorneys office takes my name and number and says that they can't really do anything until they fire her, I want to get her legal counsel while she is working and get her employer off her back. Any pointers? I live in California (at will state) if that matters at all.

You can take video calls with them or can visit to my country (Sri lanka) and check them plane ticket is cheap to Sri lanka too, anything you want to make sure its legit, i might help.

It's so sad of the disables in 3rd world countries. 99% of the disables have to stay on the bed as they don't have much access to electric wheel chairs and stuff. 

If anyone is looking to help, just lmk. 
I'm not a scammer; you can check my profile. I'm just a 23-year-old entrepreneur who is still struggling to be rich and obviously to help others. 

My final ambition is to make my country a place which is favourable for disables just like the US, UK etc.

Why do people think I'm lying?,"Why does people think I'm lying about my situation or about my age?

People have accused me being a minor when I say things like ""my mom doesn't allow me to do this"" or when I ask if ""something requires an ID"". Then when I tell them about my situation or that I'm disabled or neurodivergent they accuse me of lying about *that* because ""that's something catfishers would say when catfishing"".

Don't people know disabled adults and neurodivergent adults *do* exist? Haven't people heard of overbearing parents that infantalizes their disabled/neurodivergent adult sons or daughters?

And so what if I don't ""sound neurodivergent or disabled"" to you or if I'm well-spoken and coherent to you. That doesn't make it okay to doubt whether or not I have a disability. I'm only going by what my mom has told me and what I've seen on the paperwork. So if I'm not really disabled, then either I was misdiagnosed or either my mom fooled a bunch of doctors when I was a little kid lmao. But my official diagnosis is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder because my birth mom drank alcohol (and did cocaine) when she was pregnant with me. So I definitely have *something* which explains the paperwork.

I believe I am disabled or neurodivergent but just not to the point where my mom thinks I am and not to the point where I need to be controlled and sheltered like this. But try telling my mom that. I was even told in the legal advice sub that if I left home my mom could call the cops and have them bring me back and tell them I'm incompetent and it'll be her word over mine since I'm officially diagnosed with a mental disability.

But if it's socially UNacceptable to accuse somebody of lying about rape (**as it should be**), then why is it socially acceptable to accuse a disabled or neurodivergent adult of lying about not only being disabled or neurodivergent but *also* accuse them of lying about being in a situation where their overbearing parents shelters them and not let them do hardly anything that typical adults (or even teens, for that matter) gets to do. Just because it isn't something you can fathom or imagine doesn't mean it isn't happening. How is that any different than accusing a sex abuse victim or domestic violence victim of lying, since you're still accusing somebody of lying about something that they are experiencing or going through, or have experienced or went through?

Yes, my mom allows me to have a phone, as controlling and overbearing as she is; and she doesn't check it. But if she did found out about me doing something she doesn't approve of (such as being on social media or dating sites, which I do behind her back), she will take my phone or at least try to. And she does tell me who I can and can't talk to but I talk to people behind her back (the people she doesn't like or approve of, usually for superficial or judgy reasons). And I've been accused of using ""sock puppet"" accounts because I don't have pictures of me on public where everyone can see them and I don't have myself as my profile picture (usually a peace sign or an animal or flower). Well, I'm sorry if I offended you because I'm trying to keep people who knows me irl from coming across my profile and then telling my mom (which did happen years ago back when I was a lot less careful then I am now and yes I was over 18 then).

Yes, I'm on the Bumble app but I saved up money to pay for Bumble Premium (lifetime fee, which you pay one time and I paid with a Google Play card) so I could hide my profile and only the people I swipe right on sees my profile and I'm careful about who I swipe right on. This reduces the risk of my mom finding out I'm on Bumble. If I do meet anyone on there that I like, of course I wouldn't tell my mom that I met them on an app.

Yes, I get to be home alone. But she always makes sure to tell me to keep the doors locked before she leaves. And if I invite anyone over while I'm home alone (like I want to) and she finds out about it, that will be my last time staying home alone.

And another thing. Fear is a real thing. Just because somebody is afraid doesn't mean they're happy in their environment or that they don't want things to change or that they're seeking attention by talking about their situation that you may or may not believe is true. Sometimes talking about things just helps them cope with it, especially if they are too afraid to do anything about it.

And on top of people not believing me about my situation, I also have very bad health anxiety that has me convinced I'm dying which I feel helpless to do anything about and its to a point now where some people are thinking I'm attention-seeking because I keep talking about it and haven't done anything about it. But what can I do when my mom is ""over me"" and I feel like I have no power or voice? I'm not ""attention-seeking"" but I need to talk about it because it keeps me from losing it and keeps me calm and reassured until the health anxiety comes back and then I'm freaking out again.

I also want to say that not everyone accuses me of lying or attention-seeking (thankfully) but enough people do that I felt the need to post about it. And maybe get it through peoples heads to not assume someone is lying just because something sounds too bizarre to be true and is coming from an internet stranger.

If both Gypsy and the Turpin kids had got online (behind their parents backs) telling strangers about their situation, would they have been believed or accused of lying? I really wanna know. (I'm not here to debate the Gypsy case, whether she's a victim or not, that's not what this is about). I'm just wondering if she had gotten online telling people about her situation, would she have been accused of lying or catfishing. And I wonder the same about the Turpin kids too.

How can I find a disability-friendly career in animal care that pays a sustainable wage?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a (25F) with a disability—I have a shunt, which limits my physical abilities and may affect the kinds of jobs I can take on.

Do you work for a doctor for free?,"In the past when I went to a medical office, I gave them my driver's license and insurance card and maybe filled out a form on a little clipboard. I gave them the completed form and they gave me back my license and insurance card and that was it.

More and more I'm finding that medical offices expect patients to do the work of the admins. Recently I went to urgent care for a UTI. Before I even left the house I had to photograph and upload both sides of my license and insurance cards (what if you don't have a smart phone?) and do extensive data entry. It took me an hour. 

At the urgent care, an indifferent employee just pointed me to a card table in the restroom. There was a big mess of stuff on the table for all kinds of different issues (drug testing, STI testing, etc.). 

I had to sift through the pile to find the instructions for UTI testing, find the disposable wipes, locate a cup that didn't have a broken seal, write my info on it. 

How many other people had sifted through that same pile and were their hands clean? Gross!! 

The NP who talked to me was very nice but the admin just sat there on her phone the entire time I was there. 

Wtf. I'm the patient, not the admin. When I'm sick, I need *treatment,* not administrative tasks, and I especially don't want to work for free! Minimum wage where I live is like $14.35 an hour.

Seeking Advice for Legal Accommodations for Employing Disabled Folks,"I am a small business owner in Maryland. I employ around 20 part time workers for an extremely easy and simple job. This job can be done by two slow people or by one fast person, and I can afford to spend $20 an hour on getting this work done, so I either employ two people for $10 each, or one person for $20 if that one person can handle it.  
  
Because of the simplicity of the $10 job, the position has historically been popular with folks with disabilities, high school students, or the elderly. This was all well as good, until the minimum wage began to increase to $15. Two people $15 an hour each is $30 total. $30 is what we make in revenue alone, so it is impossible to pay $30 an hour for that position and still operate, so I had to switch to only the $20 role, and I was forced to lay off all my $10 workers if they were not able to keep up at the $20 rate.

This has worked fine for the business, I have no trouble at all finding enough capable $20 an hour workers, but this was really hard on the people I used to employ, and even now I get a lot of applicants with disabilities who want to work here, many of which can still make it at $20 an hour and I still hire without an issue such as folks with speech or mobility impediments which doesn't affect their productivity, but others cannot. Two of my former employees, for example, are both recovering coma patients. They speak slowly and carefully and move shakily and make a lot of mistakes that they DO fix ok on their own, but it takes time. I hate not being able to employ them, they do a great job if they are on a team with someone else, but could never cut it on their own.   
  
I feel there is nothing I can do, that the minimum wage law, which is made to help people, has had unintended consequences on these people. Everyone deserves a chance to work and make money, some of my former employees have begged to just work illegally, but I do not want to take that risk, especially  since I have so many employees already who can do the $20 work just fine.

Is there anything I can do that lets me employ people who cannot work very fast, make a profit, AND follow the law? It feels like I can only do two at at time...

Any help appreciated. And please do not make any personal comments about my choices, I am not here for moral judgement, I am here to try to find employment for people who want to work but can't cut it at $20 an hour. Maybe one day I will be more profitable and can pay two people $15 each, but not at this time.

Women who use mobility aids...Do kids find you approachable?,"Do kids you don't know find you very approachable even when you are using a mobility aid? It occurred to me that perhaps it's a little odd that so many children are not intimidated by my cane despite my being young...it'd be a kinda unknown to most of them so that might be scary? But then again, if they have a grandparent who uses a cane it might be familiar?

I thought I had a resting ""serious face"" but lately I've been noticing how unfamiliar kids don't find me intimidating at all and thus I'm easily approachable. Even when I'm wearing my big sunglasses that take up a lot of space on my face  or I have colorful hair... I've had adults tell me that my resting face and my walk (I stomp like an army general) is intimidating lol.

The only thing I can think is maybe it's because I'm young, short and very plump,  average/(moderately cute on a good day) and wear fun colours often? Maybe I'm more ""grandma coded"" or something? I kinda like the idea of having ""grandma"" or ""Mrs. Claus"" vibes.  

I just had a cute interaction with a toddler who approached me and wanted to take my hand lol. His family was nearby and got a kick out of it.

How do you find joy in every day life when you're basically trapped? ,"I was born without sight. My younger self never saw my disability as an obstacle, because I simply didn't know any different. However, navigating adulthood has been tricky to say the least, so I  also understand the other side.  

As a blind person, I've had no choice but to work a million times harder than my sighted counterparts, but I will admit, I am a lazy person. Part of that is probably an inherited trait from my father, but I was also institutionalized for most of my childhood, as I'd spent it at a school for the blind. I'd developed learned helplessness from being in an environment where the ableist staff basically handicapped us.

Unfortunately your career options are very limited when you can't see. You're basically resigned to either starving musician, troubleshooting humanity, or mundane computer work. I tried the music thing when I was younger, but I hated practicing and performing. Making music just doesn’t feed my soul.

I'm a very social person and enjoy interacting with humans in an informal casual setting, because I don't have to be the problem solver in those situations. However, that’s different when it’s your full time job. Teachers, therapists, social workers, and sometimes even lawyers have to be nurturers to a degree. Doing that every single day of your life is emotionally draining, especially when you yourself are neurodivergent. Compassion fatigue is real. In short, I basically feel trapped in my life.

I have always had a passion for animals. There's just something rewarding about saving their lives. The kind of unconditional love you get from animals is different from humans. If I could see, my dream career would've been a vet. I would've loved to have worked with zoo and marine animals. I would probably have more drive and motivation if there was actually something to be excited about.

On top of that something I have mild headaches for a week straight if I'm bit more tired.

I'm jealous of people who talk about their young body just recovering from anything just at 23yo.

I constantly do things even when I feel like I'm sick, in pain or fatigue, because the issues never stop coming up and I feel like if I rest my life would stop. Doctors never act worried when I tell about pains or fatigue, so I have no support nor meds. I usually didn't even have high inflammation levels when I felt like something was very wrong.

I'm used to being strong and know that I can just get over pain and discomfort even when my body is barely taking it- what else is there left to do? Now my body gave up and I got sick again after needing sick leave for fatigue last week. I've had active month emotionally and physically, so now I've been trying to do less in last weeks, but even that is extremely hard.

I can't explain what is wrong to doctors and even to people I care about. Everything feels like my own fault, my limitations are unclear even to me and I can't seem learn how to live with them without shame.

Due to life circumstances it's hard to try getting treatment currently and idk how to fight for it. Something just feels wrong with my body. 

So, my questions are- *How do you learn to navigate your issues without a diagnosis and how do you keep self-compassion in mind even on your worst days?*",18,1erekjb,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1erekjb/not_having_a_diagnosis_makes_me_feel_shame_how_to/,8,1723571877.0

Work standards changed and now I’m out of compliance ,"I’ve worked customer service for the same company for nearly 2 years now. Started as seasonal and got hired on as a permanent employee later on. It is a WFH position and up until a few months ago I was getting stellar feedback from my managers. The company then changed how they were organizing the structure and I no longer was working for the same office or the same time zone, and changed managers twice. 
Before, getting 75%+ on a quality check was perfectly fine and my time required to complete tasks including what they now call “unavailable” was not an issue. Now they are pushing very hard for 100% across the board, which is fine, I’m struggling because the standards feel very robotic but I’m making progress, but on top of those changes my extra time is now a massive problem where there was none before. Between ADHD and PTSD, I have to have extra time after speaking with someone, especially if they were difficult to speak to, because I just have lapses where I struggle to “reconnect” is the best way I can put it. I’m not sure how to discuss with the new manager regarding these things. Working under my old manager is not an option sadly. They refused. Is this something that I start with HR? Am I supposed to talk with my manager first? Should I get my medical documentation set up to send to both in case things go sideways? I’ve probably missed lots of relevant information but I’m a bit scattered so we start here. And if this is not the place to post, apologies in advance.

Disability depression I'm worried about myself ,"My disability and the recognition of it have started to spiral my depression.

To start with I'm in the UK so we have different laws and recognition about disability. So I've been recognised by the Department of Work and Pensions - DWP (Government body - part if the Civil Service) as having Limited Capability for Work Related Activities - LCWRA. I am also in receipt of Extended Personal Independance Payment. And a local council issued bus pass as I am unsafe to drive. I also have medical exemption for the visa of medication & prescriptions.

The National Health Service NHS, have diagnosed my disability and I gave the DWP full access to my medical records. They are getting together a treatment plan, physio, neuro and psych.

All of the above us really positive, yet my depression (I am receiving treatment for that as well), is getting worse. I find myself staring vacantly at the TV, putting off simple tasks until ""tomorrow"". The worst thing is that I find myself, often, returning to bed with the blackout blinds down and lying there not thinking.

The reason I'm posting this is because I'm worried about myself. I have all the concerns about being a ""burden"" on my wife, my kids don't will do nothing. The one silver lining is that my mother in law stays away as she has disability phobia - she used to make quite sick jokes about my conditions until all of the medical paperwork came through.

Anyway thank you for reading this, I may have used the flair incorrectly. And I felt I needed to get this out of my system .",11,1erc524,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1erc524/disability_depression_im_worried_about_myself/,1,1723566004.0
Seeking input on design project from grabber/reach-and-grab tool users,"Hello r/disability 

I'm working on a personal design project to improve these guys:

[the arm with no elbow](https://preview.redd.it/vydbm0dbahid1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=78858b8dd002d7c4da4485db61bfaf3d44d3efbb)

  
This was my senior design project back in mechanical engineering undergrad. At the time I was focused on starting my career, so once I graduated I didn't give it much thought. Recently I've been doing more hobby designing and 3D printing, and this has come to mind as a good challenging design project that could potentially help some people. Back in the day I reached out to a good friend of mine who works with many disabled people, and he gave me some useful critiques of these tools:

* the existing design doesn't give the user an easy way to get whatever is held by the grabber. People have to either do a complicated motion to grab the item with their other hand, or drop the item on themselves 
* it requires the user to hold the trigger the entire time to maintain grip on the item
* it puts a lot of strain on the user's wrist to pick up an item
* expense is a large consideration since disability makes it hard to find work, and insurance is reluctant to pay for such tools

I have a few ideas for how to address some of these issues:

* a retraction mechanism to allow the tool to bring the object in close to the user
* lock the grip and let the user release the trigger without dropping the item
* add an arm brace for increased stability/reduced wrist strain (similar to cuffs on forearm crutches)
* design as many parts to be 3D printed as possible
* open source the design to allow others to modify, manufacture, or improve it however they want to

3D printing has become extremely popular and accessible. In my area all the public libraries have at least one 3D printer, and they'll make parts for you at the cost of the filament which is quite cheap. I'm hoping to have a landed cost of less than $30 to make it as accessible as possible. I don't intend to make any money off of this project. My only goals are to create something useful and hone my design skills. 

I invite anyone who is interested to share their experiences with these tools and give any kind of feedback or recommendations that may be useful. Let me know if you think the features listed would be helpful, or if you think they'd be a waste of effort. I'd particularly like to find some people who would be willing to give me feedback throughout the design process, so if you're interested please message me!",5,1erhhkt,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1erhhkt/seeking_input_on_design_project_from/,1,1723578928.0

Don’t wait for things to get “that” bad before you accept help.  Take a step back and see what might be beneficial, and don’t listen to the people who say “if you sit in that chair, you won’t be able to use your legs at all”.  You decide what is good for you!

Someone claimed I have internalized ableism. Do I?,"Hello, all. Looking to partially vent and also for some opinions. I was diagnosed by my therapist as having level 1 (or low-support level) Autism when I was about 25. I chose to not have it placed on my medical records to avoid potential issues with insurance and such (which, in and of itself is an issue, but not the one to be discussed now). And while I am part of a disabled community, I do not personally refer to myself as disabled. I have no issues with being labeled as disabled, but I just personally feel that my life experience hasn't been affected to that point, especially in comparison to others within my community. 

An individual I got into a bit of a debate with made the statement that I do not get to decide whether or not I am disabled, and that my not considering myself disabled is internalized ableism. I disagree, as I believe it is everyone's individual choice as to how to identify themselves. I also prefer identity-first language because my Autism directly influences how I perceive and interact with the world and is therefore an important aspect of my identity: I am autistic. But, I certainly do not disparage those who prefer person-first language and want to be considered distinct from their disability. Similarly, I would never tell someone with the same  or similar presentation of Autism as me that they are not disabled should they choose to identify as such. 

Do I actually have internalized ableism, or is this person trying to shame me for not conforming to their world view?",70,1eqr5a8,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eqr5a8/someone_claimed_i_have_internalized_ableism_do_i/,70,1723501155.0
Do you feel bad when you don’t help someone disabled? ,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. I think it stems from both of my parents being physically handicapped at different points due to illness, but I always feel compelled to offer help to someone who seems disabled. 

I used to frequently offer help to any person who was wheelchair bound or with a cane. More often than not, when I asked, they said no. Eventually, I learned to “read the room,” so to speak. I learned to distinguish between someone genuinely needing help or someone who is disabled but they got things under control and I would just be annoying and embarrass them if I offered help. Only once in a while, I feel like I read it wrong and I should’ve offered help. 

I think these strong feelings come from both of my parents being physically handicapped at various points. My mom struggled with mobility in the final years of her life. Last year, my dad broke his hip and it was because of lymphoma. He spent half of last year using a walker at home and when we went for his chemotherapy appointments, I pushed him in a wheelchair. He’s only now starting to wean off using a cane outside of the house. 

I had to help both my parents get around, so I guess I feel protective over disabled people. But the last thing I want to do is insult them, because I also know from my parents how embarrassing it can be under certain circumstances. 

Am I making any sense? ",5,1er5ln1,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1er5ln1/do_you_feel_bad_when_you_dont_help_someone/,14,1723549098.0
"I am 18 years old, and feel really alone in my health problems. ","Hi, I am 18m, and I have a lot of undiagnosed issues since over a year back. It feels like every time progress is made, it gets worse. I basically don't get any help. My problems started because of my hips. I used to be really active in the cheerleading community. A few years ago I dreamed to go international, but last year I had to quit because of the pain. 

My hips hurt so much. I can't even lay down without my hips hyper extending in a wrong direction. I discovered it because I couldn't sleep at night due to the pain. 

Adding onto the pain and hips issues, I likely have nerve damage. This leaves especially my legs really, really weak. It's like I can't properly communicate with them. The worst part is the way they tingle though. It never stops, and it's driving me crazy. I can't get them to stop tingling, no matter what I do. It doesn't really hurt, but it makes me want to rip my skin off. 

I am often in pain, always weak and always tired. And since they healthcare sucks where I live, I don't get help for any of it. I don't know if I am ill, or have an injury, or something entirely else. 

I feel really alone, and unsure where I fit in.

Vent,"I got certain treatment(TMS) today, and the affect kind of seemed hopeful and i feel frustrated how it went. 

1. I didnt get the full 20min, 
But only like a min though.
Doc thought I was being so sensitive mentally abt it as seeing my reaction and worries (as i have hypochondria) then called it a day. 

I am not sure whether he will keep the treatment with me again when I visit him after. Even so the tratment is kind of not difficult to get here in my country, so I think I can find and visit another place if I want i guess. 

2. I was being ill for very long time, more than a decade, and visited this hospital a lot  and knew that theres this machine. But I thought its expensive(300$ for 20 session, and i definetely could pay for it) even though it wasnt, reminding i dont have proper insurance to cover it. And also cuz of no reason, I always never really have real chance to try it it at all. When I finally asked abt it today, I only had to pay like 15$ for kind of experience. 

Even though i only got the sip of it, I had effect and side effect right away since my body is so sensitive so weak i guess. It always happens to me. I felt my head clear and my body and tooth ache. But as time goes by, the bad side affect kind of went away and still the good one left. Only toothache is kind of still left😢

Though I am not sure if full 20 minute treatment would work in same way( maybe the side effect can go bad i worry too), i kind of expect it can be. But still this uncertainty feels anxious. And I even feel anxious about its hopeful dramatic result, while thinking i neglected it for 10 whole lost years. I always wanted to try it, but somehow I didnt. Like theres some invisible hands or sth. 

Right, its also uncertain I could have been better if I tried it earlier, but it pretty much seems so. And I feel so stupid for

A. Didnt try it for long
B. Didnt try for expense
C. Being stopped by being anxious
D. Not knowing how it will go with full treatment
E. Critisize myself over hopeful probability

I have tried classes to regulate my emotions and I’m still struggling. I managed to get a small retail job stocking shelves for less than 20 hours a week but I fear that won’t last much longer because i’m too depressed to show up. Any advice on what the hearing will be like. How to respond to questions effectively and what to expect is appreciated. Even though I have a lawyer he didn’t prep me and I feel like i’m going in this alone. ,4,1eqzxnj,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eqzxnj/disability_hearing_coming_up/,7,1723526816.0
"My brother just rubbed it in my face how much more he’s earning than I am, and I can’t believe he’d do that...","My brother just rubbed it in my face how much more he’s earning compared to me, and I can’t believe he’d do that. Especially since I’m currently unemployed, he flaunted his salary increase and bragged about how much more he makes, even suggesting that I’ll never earn as much as he does (It’s most likely true, but why rub it in your brother’s face?). It’s beyond me how someone can be so lacking in empathy.

Why would he want to boast about his success when he knows I’m struggling due to my disability? **It’s not about being envious of his money, I’m genuinely hurt and disappointed by his lack of empathy.**

It’s heartbreaking to see that the last person in my family I expected to be so insensitive is my own brother. I thought he would be understanding and supportive, but it looks like I was wrong… Some people just don’t seem to be able to put themselves in other people’s shoes. I just don’t get it. At least I can now say with 100 percent certainty that everyone in my immediate family has a personality made of garbage.

Not sure what to ask for (work accommodations),"[this has also been posted in r/POTS, and it was suggested to post here]

Going to apologize now for this being wordy but I’m unsure on what to ask for but NEED advice. 

I’ve been diagnosed with POTS since January- so all of this is still relatively new for me to even understand myself and my own body. I also have hEDS (shocker).
I recently started an in office job that I’m about to hit my 90 days at. This is the first in office position I have worked since 2018, previously has all been remote. It’s a great gig, I really enjoy it, and the team is very kind. Even my boss is a nerd like me and very supportive and empathetic to my health. HR was also made aware of my conditions once I was hired. They seem very alright about everything. Got me a nice chair for my office, cool with me taking breaks, and said I can work remotely if needed. I asked if they (HR) needed me to acquire any medical documentation to keep on hand - she said not to worry about it unless there is some really specific accommodation I needed they haven’t been able to fulfill. 

Now, here’s where things get a little.. odd. The job originally was posted as a hybrid role. I opted to work in office since this is a whole new industry for me and for the position I work in (marketing coordinator) I need the education. They said they were fine for this to “work into a hybrid role”. Cool. No biggie. 
A few weeks ago I had a POTS episode. I take meds, do the lifestyle adjustments and changes, everything. But as most things with our bodies, things just happen. I had to leave early because my heart rate was “rubber banding” even while sitting still. Bossman was cool with it, even asked me to text him when I got home just for him to know I was alright (he was concerned). Well, HR had a fucking field day. I got this email from her making it out like I told them this was under control and it isn’t, and that this happens often. It’s happened one literal time since I started here. I also went home, got settled worked remote, then worked remote that following day. I took it seriously because the following week I was scheduled to go out of town for a conference. So since that, NOW they want documentation. ???? Wtf? 
So in my mind - alright, bet. I’ll get that to keep on hand, because I DO know my ADA rights very very well. I doubt that would become the case, but maybe I’m just hopeful. To me it just sounds like she’s doing too much for the sake of her own job. 

My question really is, what accommodations should I ask for? My boyfriend thinks I should ask for remote work, one so I don’t have to deal with HR at all and I can just work like I typically do (I have a crazy work drive that sometimes gets the best of me). My fear is asking for remote or hybrid (like 2 days in office) may cause more issue. I like this job and besides all this, I have no issue. My POTS are roughly stable. I’m not fainting, I still have little minor episodes that are very fleeting, I could control my diet more at home, but I get better exercise (light walking) in the office. Working an office job has taken a toll on my energy levels; once I’m home, I body shower and I’m beat. I might be able throw something in the oven that’s frozen for dinner, but that’s absolutely it. Working remote would allow me to have better energy. I don’t know.

But my knee damage is so severe he told me I need to stop driving every day for a living and get a sitting job. No stairs, no long periods of standing. He wrote me a letter saying sitting jobs only.

Apparently I'm toxic slime!?,"Ok. I have a genetic disease that causes tumors to grow at the ends of my nerves, mainly in my spine and brain but the tumors can grow wherever they want to.  I'm 49. I have 2 adult daughters with kids.  I'm deaf. My youngest daughter 24 and a mom of 2 children. She just had her 1st tumor removal surgery and made me aware that I'm toxic.  My mom wasn't the shining example of a mother but at some point I have to say yeah, I know I'm not the best mom. This child of mine is actually a great mom. I knew she would be when she wad a toddler just by how she would treat other kids so i'm not surprised at how well she's doing as a mom. My 27 yr old was diagnosed with O.D.D. as a 8 or 9 year old. She would physically hit me and her younger sister so I asked her where she wanted to live and made it legal.  When my youngest was 10, I took her and left my mom's house.  I was 35. By then I was deaf, I didn't drive but I had to get my 10 yr old out of the unsafe situation.  My mom would team up with my 1st born and they would literally just say and do mean and hurtful things to my youngest and myself.  
      Then 1 day after a year, my mother texted me and said she wad going to give my 1st born over to the state bc she couldn't control her anymore.  So I talked to my bf who actually used to babysit my 1st born when she was a year and a half old and he didn't like seeing me cry, he didn't really like my mom and he wanted to help so I talked to mom and she would not sign custody of her back to me but she'd sign custody over to my bf. Idk what her reasoning was. She's currently dealing with dementia so I can't just say hey,why did you do this? My bf has been dead for about 6 months now and he figured it was a way for mom to say screw you.  Makes total sense! 
     I was recently made aware that I'm a ""toxic"" person and that I shouldn't have had my girls and I'm selfish.   I've Apologized profusely for being a shitty mom.  I can't change the past. I'm sorry their Fathers weren't around growing up but that wasn't up to me. Their dad's made that choice.  I have tried to Apologize for any and everything that I did that was traumatic to them and it's just not good enough. I don't want to lose them but it feels like I might.  I've tried asking them to a face to face meeting and just throw everything out on the table. Get it out and stop holding it in buttbat didn't go over well.  One has totally ignored that topic and the other one doesn't want to go face to face, and that doesn't feel right to me but I'm not going to push it.   What else can I try? I currently live with my oldest daughter and I think both of us have been walking on eggshells but we're being civil.  Both have suggested I go to a nursing home. I don't really want to though.  I'm only 49 and disabled. I'm a huge fall risk buti haven't fallen in 4 months now. Advice would be well received please.  And please be nice,  what would you do with your mom?

What are the hardest parts of depression/depressive episodes for you?,"Hi all, I’m doing a small series on my Instagram about depression. I’m not a big person and I don’t have lots of followers or anything…I’m just a regular woman who is working to come to terms with her own cptsd/anxiety/depression combo and I find researching and learning more is helping me.

"Mom had stroke, no clue how to handle SSD/if still able to, help pls? (TLDR at end, wasn’t sure what was necessary to include, sorry)","hi, first time using reddit, sorry if there’s any issues w/ me posting this, but i can’t find any help online. my dad/her husband is no help, and mom is too confused/unmotivated to continue trying to figure this out. we have been struggling a lot financially, with more expenses coming up soon, so i’m trying to see what i can do.

background:  
my mother had a stroke in february, and works in a school system. she had issues with communication and processing, basically all mental, almost no physical symptoms. doctors determined the stroke probably happened due to a small hole in her heart, which she then had a PFO closure surgery in June to fix. she still has some issues, but can generally function how she could before, after all this time and seeing a speech therapist (who my dad told her was okay to stop seeing, bc she didn’t like going to. she was a few points away from the ‘baseline’ still, according to the therapist, but oh well). my mom hadn’t seen a doctor regularly in years, and has only had one appointment w the physician she just got.

i believe she filed FMLA, and i attempted to help her with it, but i do not know for sure what happened/the whole process. anyways.

  
current issue:

i only found out at the end of last month, that short term disability needed to be on our radar. my dad works, and family dynamics arent that great, so he put me in charge of helping my mom ‘figure out what we need to do’. my mom has become incredibly difficult to work with, bc she gets frustrated easily, does not like being told she is wrong/what to do, and doesn’t always understand what she should. eventually, we found we need to ask her doctor to fill out a form for it, called the office, and they told us that she refused to fill out disability forms. my mom is going back to work, and things are going okay so far (though it’s only been a week, and i’ve seen some messages abt her boss needing work things from her. lowkey worried she could get in trouble/demoted/fired from her manager position).

  
TLDR/Question:

is it too late to find some work around, get with another doctor, etc, and receive short term disability pay for the time where she was unable to work while recovering? (mid. February—August) also, maybe any tips for talking abt things like this without making her upset?

Review of Project Relate and Voiceitt: speech-to-text apps for speech differences,"Hey all, I have been trying out accessibility tools for speech disabilities, and figured I’d give an in-depth review of two apps I’ve been trying recently: Project Relate and Voiceitt. I originally wrote this review for r/ headandneckcancer, but figured it may be useful for a broader range of people so reposting it here with mod blessing!

[https://sites.research.google/relate/](https://sites.research.google/relate/)

[https://www.voiceitt.com/](https://www.voiceitt.com/)

Voiceitt and Project Relate are 2 speech-to-text AI platforms aimed at people with speech differences. The basic concept of both tools is you pre-record pre-determined phrases; once you’ve recorded the minimum number, an AI model of your voice is trained and you can start speaking and the AI will be able to transcribe what you’re saying in real-time, to allow you to dictate longer written texts, or to provide captions in real time

TL;DR of the review: I like both of these tools a lot over my current alternatives. Both have strengths and weaknesses, the tech is still relatively new and has a lot of potential. If you think this might help you, I’d recommend giving them a try if you’re able to invest the time in training.

(As a disclaimer: I have a near total glossectomy, so I’m missing functionally all my tongue, and have a fairly significant speech impediment. Most people can understand me with a little effort after about 20 minutes of conversation. I’m a scientist, so I use technical language all the time, and I’m regularly teaching people who aren’t used to my voice. When I first heard about these apps, I wanted them to help conversations one on one, and to use them as subtitles when presenting. I also don’t have any other disabilities. Also, when I was trying them out I wasn’t planning to write a review so this might not be completely comprehensive, and it is my opinion. Your mileage may vary!)

# Set up and training:

First off, Project Relate is currently only available on Android as an app. It’s in beta at the moment. Voiceitt, (or Voiceitt2, specifically) on the other hand, is a web app, so can be accessed on multiple devices, but it’s dependent on an internet connection. Project Relate is free as of writing, Voiceitt has a free trial period, but then charges monthly.

I found both very easy and simple to set up, with clear instructions and big buttons. PR can just be downloaded from the app store, whereas I had to email the local distributor (Adapt-it, in the UK) of Voiceitt to get an account, but that was no hassle. Both offer a mode for if someone is helping you set it up. Voiceitt also offers additional accessibility tools which I didn’t personally explore.

I won’t lie to you: training takes a while and is boring. Voiceitt requires a minimum of 200 phrases. PR says they need 500, but generated my first model after around 300. In both cases, this took me around 3 hours cumulatively. You can take as long to record these as you like, so if you can only record 20 or 5 phrases a day or whatever that’s no big deal. You can skip any phrases that you don’t want to record, and both apps can “say” the phrase before you say it. Voiceitt has a maximum timer on how long you can take to say a phrase, which for some phrases felt short for me.

Once you’ve trained the minimum, both apps let you record custom phrases. That’s great for teaching things like people’s names, locations, or specific vocabulary. This has been a game changer for me at reception desks for hospital appointments, but also at work. Project Relate lets you have letters, numbers, and basic punctuation in these custom phrases, so you can teach it your address, while Voiceitt only allows letters. Voiceitt offers a shortcut phrase, where you could say a short phrase, and it will write out a longer message - very cool.

The minimum is just a minimum, the more you train, the better it works. And this will be variable based on your specific speech. After 700 phrases, PR still says its understanding of my voice is “medium”. But I find that’s fine for occasional use!

# Using the AI:

Once you’re all trained up, you can start using the AI. You can either speak, and the AI will write it down, or you can speak, and the AI will repeat it out loud. Voiceitt also splits up its functionality into a conversation mode and a dictation mode. The conversation mode is for shorter phrases, dictation is for longer speaking.

PR seems to process the audio word by word, popping up immediately after you speak. Voiceitt seems to wait for you to finish a phrase or sentence before transcribing, but in my experience that often makes it more accurate, just slightly slower. Both apps do better with shorter phrases and frequent pauses, so struggle more the longer I speak uninterrupted. Both apps make mistakes fairly regularly, but that will improve as I train more phrases.

I found the Voiceitt conversation mode only really worked for really short sentences - it would split my sentence onto 2 screens, which wasn’t very helpful for me, so I mostly used the dictate mode. Both coped well with most of the technical phrases that I taught them. I never really tried the options where the AI repeated what it thought I said out loud, but I could see that being a function appealing to some people.

Voiceitt also offers a function where the text is flipped upside down so that you can have the phone flat in front of you and the other person can read, which I thought was neat.

What I wanted from both apps was the ability to change font size, so that I could make the text bigger if someone is further away from me (or for accessibility reasons!). This is something the “Speech Assistant” text-to-speech app I use does very well, and I miss it in these.

Both AIs struggled if there was background noise: other conversations nearby, wind, music or being in a vehicle all posed additional challenges, so in those situations, I used alternative tools.

# Additional Functions:

Along with what I would call the “Core function” of being able to dictate in the app and have the app write a live transcript, both tools offer additional functions:

**Transcription outside the app:** Voiceitt has a Chrome extension that you can use on other webpages, so you could use it to dictate emails or write on forums, etc. Project Relate has the Relate Keyboard which you can use to dictate in other apps on your Android device. This is incredible if you also have challenges typing (fatigue, motor disabilities, etc), but I didn’t try this out.

**Smart Assistants:** PR lets you speak to Google Assistant, on your phone, so you can ask it the weather, set a timer, etc. I don’t think at this moment it integrates with Google Home devices, but I haven’t tried. Voiceitt doesn’t, but its website points out that by having the app repeat what you said out loud, it can help you speak to your smart home devices. (Presumably also true for PR) This is something I’ll play with more in the future because I used to love having my silly voice-controlled lights, and I can see it being a game changer if you have a disability that affects your mobility.

**Integration with Video Call Apps:** Voiceitt, through Webex, offers integration with video call apps like Microsoft teams and Zoom. I didn’t try this because my job is entirely in-person, and I very rarely have video meetings, but if in the future that changes, this would be one of the most important features for me. It functions that there would be a pop-up in the video call where people could read the transcription as you speak, same as if you were holding your phone up in person. This does come with an additional cost.

# Additional Comments and Verdict:

Both services worked well for me. The alternative for me is that on the occasions when people are struggling to understand me, I often have to pause and write it down. Just having the live transcription there has made those conversations much more fluid. Both apps do make mistakes, that will improve as I train them more, but the feedback I receive from people speaking with me is that even when the app is wrong, it provides more of a hint of what I am saying. And I found people became used to my voice faster so we stopped needing aids sooner or as often in the conversation.

There are situations where both apps struggle. I tried to use Voiceitt as a tool recently when I was presenting in a large group meeting with a slide deck. Because the Voiceitt app took up part of the screen space separate to the slide deck, the feedback was that there was too much happening on my screen. Because both apps struggle more with long uninterrupted speech, they make more mistakes. This will only improve as the technology improves. I would love to see integration in the future where the dictation looks more like movie subtitles under my slide deck. But for conversations in quiet places with people who aren’t used to my voice, both have been immeasurably valuable.

Customer support, when I contacted both teams, was thorough and efficient. Voiceitt’s distributors also offer additional support if you need it. In the spirit of Nothing About Us Without Us, both have had staff with speech differences involved in the project. Both have speech therapy experts involved.

Voiceitt is subscription-based, so there is a cost there. But paying for this would likely fall under “reasonable accommodations” at work and school, and there are grants in many places to support paying for this type of technology.

For myself, I’ve chosen to stick with Project Relate for now. I’m keeping a close eye on Voiceitt to see what new features it offers, and if I ever swap to a job that has frequent video call meetings, I’ll probably go back to Voiceitt. I see incredible potential in this technology, and it is still relatively new. It will only improve in the next few years. If you’re up for the long training process, I think both are worth a shot.

Let me know if you have any questions about either!",1,1eqqijv,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eqqijv/review_of_project_relate_and_voiceitt/,0,1723499625.0

Accommodations at home,"Hi all,
Has anyone been through a similar situation?

I live in a building that receives money from the fed gov (in the us) to house disabled and older folks.

The entry way is a beast to get in and out of and many folks can't leave their apartment without help due to the door.

I'm a person who can't get in without help and have gone through the process of accommodations in the state of Maryland. I think they are letting it stall out, trying to slowly collect 6 different quotes.. (in an area where the number of contractors is small). It's been years and many different people have filed about the lack of accessible entry. It's kind of horrific to even type out. Folks have died of depression complications from not being able to get out on their own for sunshine etc, all because of the door to the building. 

Is there a time line where the request dies if certain steps don't manifest? Do I have to find out and ride their asses?

Looking into legal help but if anyone knows the best practices for accommodations guidelines or how to easily access... cognition for digging up info and reading comprehension are not happening anymore. I'd like to get an idea of what kinds of info might be useful to their potential arguments. I'm sorry if I'm a nube with some of these woes and still feel this but damn does anyone else feel so damn tired of having it be a shock to folks at a disabled housing institution (or similar) that we are indeed disabled. There's a soft gas lighting and it's supremely bone chillingly spiritually exhausting to me anywho.

How do you receive assistance for a non-visible disability at an airport?,"I'm autistic and have EDS and a bunch of other untreated physical issues that cause me to be easily confused and exhausted. I've gone through airports a couple times and it has always been hell, I'm in an extreme amount of pain from the walking, I am rushed through security faster than I can manage my luggage, i struggle to make it through the aisle or stow my carry-on, and other passengers and airport assistants are constantly rude to me because it takes me longer to do things than the average person and i don't pick up on things that are obvious to everyone else like instructions and signs.

i really think I would benefit from disability assistance or pre-boarding, but anytime I try to actually mention Im disabled to someone at the airport, they get really confrontational with me which destroys the little emotional energy i have to get through the procedure at all.

I've been told by a couple people to ""just go up and ask them,"" and I genuinely have tried, but they are always rude to me and turn me away/treat me like a lost child telling me to just go to my gate. i only ever get assistance when I'm visibly on the verge of collapsing and someone notices and offers to help.

"Does anyone else get ""voluntold"" to do things because they don't have a day job?","I'm annoyed that there are some people who think my free time is their free time to use. I will get asked or told to do things (for free, with no reward) for other people. They often get hostile if I refuse. They may want me to organize something, or research something for them online. Sometimes I get asked to make art for something (I have some specific creative talents) all for free. I do my best to say no to most of these requests unless it is somebody who is offering something in return, or if they have done similarly difficult or time consuming tasks for me. I just get really annoyed that there are so many people that think my not having a job means I have any extra free time. I spend a good portion of my day just trying to care for myself. Cooking is difficult and time consuming, bathing is difficult and time consuming, keeping up with physical therapy is necessary and time consuming. At the end of it all I see people with regular jobs have more time and energy for leisure than I do on a good day, and then they want to take away my free time to use for themselves. I am annoyed by it, and also annoyed by the hostility I get for saying no.

Nonprofit idea - Free outdoor mobility aid rental,"I used to live a very active life before ME/CFS and POTS changed my life a few years ago. I stopped everything, working, outdoors, travel, because I had no choice. I have been blessed to go from severe to moderate ME and can work a few hours per week and go outdoors with aids. I recently have acquired some incredible mobility devices (electric off road trike, and lightweight foldable TSA travel power chair) that have allowed me to have experiences outdoors again. I would like to find a way to share these experiences with my disabled community. 

My current idea is starting an organization that allows local vetted members rent my equipment, and acquire more equipment, free of charge. I’ve been thinking a lot about the logistics and details, but I wanted to ask the community a few general questions to see if this would actually be useful. 

1. I am blessed to live with “only” moderate  ME currently. And want to enjoy the outdoors, but require mobility aids to do so. Are there enough people like me? Or are most more severe (can’t go outdoors), and or less severe (don’t need aids to manage outdoors). 

2. Is renting (picking up and dropping off) these big mobility aids too much work for our community, meaning it wouldn’t be used?

3. Is this helpful at all? Have you ever wanted to get outdoors but not had the funds to acquire the aids? Would these aids get you outdoors? All the aids I’m envisioning are beyond insurance coverage. 

4. What else would be helpful? What is preventing you from travel or from getting outdoors? Do you want to be outdoors? Would this be useful?

5. Any feedback is appreciated.

Received Medicare how to proceed forward?,"30 something/m, Pennsylvania  
  
Not sure what to include or not, but I have no idea what to do going forward, but know that I need to move forward.

  
Allergic reaction to infant vaccine at birth, suspected cognitive issues, wasn't able to see until long after the statue of limitations ran out(the passivity side effect is a factor in me being a recluse. A big win was two years or so ago some shady person asked for my ID for the cellphone buyback machine. First instinct was to go ""sure"", but was able to override it. severe problems with some maths, and logical/mathematic issues, difficulty engaging in complex tasks and etc. Sometimes when I type, sentences are messed up, with the beginning in the end or the end in the begging, or worse, whole parts of the sentence are radically different then what I wanted to type, or words would be different. Didn't become an issue until after I learned to type the proper way.).

Still dealing with trauma from toddler/childhood and etc. The worst was when my mom was seriously considering divorce when I was around 4-ish, landlord she called, called back at the worst time(when dad, siblings and me were in the house), so he did the ""perfectly rational thing""/sarc for holding a four year old against a wall and engage in a horrific interrogation. My memories of it are in the third person. Probably spent most of my life outright trapped in a fluctuating weird mental state, that I still find myself slipping into. 

2nd Grade, never had homework, and because of the prior mentioned event, when I was at school I could not remember home, when I was at home couldn't remember school. Teacher frustrated over ""homework""(legit didn't know the meaning of the word back then) would physically assault me, verbally assault me, and got the rest of the class to join in, kicking me deeper down in self imprisonment.    


Towards the end of the year, my psyche/soul/mind fractured? After classmates took the bullying to the playground, I didn't understand what was going on, because playground memories segregated from classroom memories, and was simply unaware, even though I felt the emotional wounds from it all. I tried to find the words for how evil they were, as the word ""evil"" seemed lacking, and could not even the find the words to describe how I felt. While staring at the sky, after failing to find the words, I felt starting in my head, like halfway through my right eye, from top of head down to my feet, begin to break away.

As it was about to break away completely, I felt/heard it howling, and in my heart I howled with it, and the process stopped. Below my heart melted back into me, at my heart I felt it intertwine with me? It was a powerful force throughout much of my life, but more recently is silent as long as I acknowledge data/feelings from it. When I don't, it is unruly.

Add in more trauma and stuff throughout teens years, I kind of failed at life. Extreme recluse, probably a schizoid or something(never drove more then 40-60 miles from home alone, only associate with my mom who I live with, nieces and nephews and siblings who live nearby. Extreme to mild aversion to relatives who looked the other way while dad was abusive/negligent.).

Beyond that, mild back issues due to injury during my late teens. After catching covid three times, developed some problems I was able to treat, but persistent heel problems in both heels. On a good to average day, nothing wrong. If I over exert myself, mild to severe pain that causes me to require a walker to get around the house. During lockdowns, did some supplement therapies for the lolz, and it had a profound effect, when I reached a certain tipping point, my brain reset and my life flashed before my eyes off and on for a few months and my memory became more unified.

Recently, I qualified for and received Medicare benefits. The problem is, I don't know what to do next, and the whole thing fills me with dread and terror when I think about it.  It's like seeing a building in the distance, walking up to it and not only not able to find the doorway, but filled with intense anxiety about walking into the building. 

How can I use my benefits to achieve the best possible increase to quality of life? SSI is one route, but it is all so overwhelming.

The little boy told him to let go of the door because he had to use the bathroom, my brother said there was a urinal I assumed he had to go number two so I was trying to hurry, then I hear my brother say “you do not have to hit me, please just wait.” My brother has the patience of a saint because then as I’m looking down this little boy kicks my brother in his knee and caught my brother off guard, halfway opened the toilet and my brother proceeded to completely stand in front of the door, my brother tells him to stop being a little shit, he did cuss at him I won’t lie there but then the boy lets out this high pitched scream and stomps his way out the bathroom.

Like the little boy escalated so quickly to put his hands on someone he ain’t ever met before, my brother tells me to hurry up and I was finally able to go pee but then as I’m getting my pants up the little boy comes back in with another man who was his dad, I hear “This is who you were talking about?” Which is never a good sign to hear coming from a parent so then automatically this man raises his voice saying why are refusing him to let his son use the bathroom, my brother was mumbling and said because someone is trying to use the bathroom now the man went “Huh?!” Then said “Speak up, boy ain’t no one can understand a damn thing you say” 

My brother kept saying someone was in there and the man is only getting louder like the situation escalated as fast as his son except this was a grown man so now the situation got scary for real, I yelled from the other side apologizing and saying im almost done, this makes the dad mad at me and told me a woman had no business being in the men bathroom and he was going to call the cops if I didn’t hurry up and get out, I was able to get my pants up quick enough as he was saying this so I said “Okay I’m done” and told my brother to get me, my brother opens the door, unfolds my wheelchair and pulls it out.

So my first look at this man, this man looked like a heavy user which I’m going to leave it at that because I didn’t know why the man was so pissed off but now I knew why but I don’t know what he was thinking but when my brother slammed open that wheelchair I heard him go “Oh” And I apologized, I told him I can’t use the bathroom by myself but the Dad apologized and told me that he was so sorry and he didn’t see a wheelchair, no joke this man tries to crack a little joke afterwards saying how it was so small he didn’t see it and I bet I’m glad it could fold up like that, I didn’t laugh but my brother awkwardly laughs and quickly got me out of the bathroom, we didn’t even stay for the movie we just decided to go home after that.

Anyone else with BLE lymphedema?,"Four years ago I was diagnosed with BLE lymphedema which is relatively rare compared to other forms of lymphedema, which are usually caused by cancer or cancer treatment and affect only one limb. I have had a really bad flare up recently and it’s really making me upset. I work in healthcare so I need to be able to walk and stand for long periods of time, which I can but I generally need to take a break at least hourly to rest my feet and calves which start burning and aching pretty quickly. I also have a trip coming up where I’ll have to do a lot of walking, and I’m really scared I’m going to need a lot of breaks to be able to make it through it. I have some vascular scans coming up after my trip to double check that my issues aren’t due to venous insufficiency but last time I had them done my veins were fine. Between my diagnosis and today, I had like two years of relatively low symptoms, because I had lost a lot of weight. I gained weight about a half year ago because I got put on a lot of new meds at once and my doctors and I are slowly trying to figure out which one is causing the weight gain and I really hope that losing weight again will help with the symptoms because I’m in so much pain every day that I have to move from my bed.

Airline said they’ll ’pray for me’,"I’m really upset by an interaction I just had with British Airways and I really just need to let it out to people who understand. I am 29 and have arthritis in my spine, so really limited mobility and constant pain. It took me 4 years to be taken seriously and to see a neurosurgeon because I’m ’too young to be in this much pain’ so I don’t know if I’m just sensitive to this kind of comment but it feels really inappropriate. 

I’ve got return flights to Nashville from London in September - when I found out my spine was only going to get worse, me and my (now) Wife cancelled our fancy wedding, went to the registry office and booked a once in a lifetime bucket list trip. I’ve requested disability assistance to help with luggage and boarding the plane in both directions. When I booked this, the BA rep told me that because I’m disabled I don’t have to pay the fee to reserve a seat which I was so grateful for as I’ve recently had to stop working. 

So today I rang up to reserve seats for the way back and the guy said 
“Just because you’ve requested support doesn’t mean you deserve a free seat, what’s actually wrong with you?” 
I told him about my condition and he sat and googled it and said 
“wow, that does sound awful, I’ll pray for you.” 

I find it quite triggering when people say things like that anyway because it makes me feel like they’re acknowledging my life is shit and needs praying for. My condition isn’t going to get better and I’m trying every damn day to live life to the fullest, your prayers can’t do anything. 

But I think just the accusatory tone from this guy, after recently having to go through the process of getting PIP and a blue badge and justifying my existence has just really struck a nerve. 

I don’t know, maybe I’m overreacting but I’m really upset and it just feels really inappropriate that he had to google my condition to see if I was worthy of support? ",232,1eosc65,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eosc65/airline_said_theyll_pray_for_me/,42,1723294404.0

How can I help my dad be more independent?,"My dad’s had a series of brain surgeries over the last 10 years that have left him effectively bedridden. He has very little control over his legs & one arm, and the other arm is very weak.

"I suffer with extreme IBS, Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Attacks, Severe Anxiety, Fatigue, Zero Energy, Memory Loss, Insomnia. ","I've suffered from constipation since I was a tween. So I tried the high fiber, exercising, Metamucil, laxatives, EVERYTHING.  I am in complete discomfort every day, every single day. I have went over 2 weeks without a movement. This CANNOT be healthy. All these toxins in my body.
Dealing with this for 30 years. Eventually I started using saline enemas about once a week, but they never completely empty my bowels. They did seem to be my best option. 
When I do poop, they are rock hard & like gumball sized. As I've gotten older, especially in the last few years it's gotten so severe that I'm in constant pain... Like can't move laying in fetal position sometimes in tears. I can literally feel the solid rock turds moving through my intestines. Especially when what used to be rounded, started probably compacting so much that they have sharp edges. 
They only way I can explain it is that it feels like Freddie Kruger is in my stomach slowly moving & ripping my insides! It's excruciating! The enemas don't seem to go up far enough to empty so the slight relief is only short lived. 
My doctor doesn't seen to understand the severity of this all. I finally urged him to send me to a specialist. So I had a colonoscopy up the rear & down the throat & was excited hoping they could find some fixable blockage or something. 
My results showed that I have a healthy ""twisty bowel"". So great this has plagued my entire life & now it's gotten so bad I rarely leave the house. 
So doctor finally prescribed me Linzess & I was hopeful... took it a month & within first week I feel pain 85% of my life. Bloated, gas, the rocks that inhabit my insides. I have shit myself multiple times a day for weeks. Just out of nowhere. It's like oily green & just a small amount each time. I'm terrified to even leave the house. I've gotta go back to work & I'm terrified! I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE. It's debilitating. Embarrassing. Idk what else to do. 
I made an appointment with another GI & all they have is a video chat appointment!
Like what in the world is that going to do? I've thought maybe a stool sample? 
I live in Greenville area South Carolina.
Anyone that has any suggestions please enlighten me! I'm now 43 & the thought that I'm only middle aged & may have to just live in this agony & constant anxiety isn't ok. 
I'm completely depressed & mad at myself. 
Please list years, questions, alternate diagnosis, anything that'll get me tests that might at the very least lessen the agonizing pain. It's effected every aspect of my life & I CANNOT live several more decades like this.

Disability help,"Hello! I’m new to Reddit, and I downloaded it because I’m hoping that I can find someone who can help me figure out what’s wrong with me. I have tried time and time again to try and get a professional opinion or diagnosis, but they all just pass it off as “growing pain”. I know, and I’ve always known that’s not what it is. Before I get any further let me just explain what my symptoms are.

Aches and pains in my leg bones, specifically in the knees, ankles, and hips of both of my legs.

Pain best described as something inside my bones eating away at them.

Pain is worse in left leg and can literally travel through my leg from area to area and even leg to leg.

Hip and thigh muscles are tender almost all the time.

 Pain seems to flair up worst when I’m having an anxiety attack.

I’m in pain every day non stop if I don’t take medicine, and if I do take medicine it usually goes away for a day or two and then comes back not long afterwards.

Pain can vary in severity but is usually around a 5/10 or higher. 



It’s been like this pretty much my entire life, but when I was younger my legs used to also lock up sometimes but don’t at the moment. When I wear compression socks it helps a little I think, taking pain medicine used to help it go away but now it only does sometimes, and only certain medicines help at all. Increased physical activity can make it flair up but not always, when I’m on my legs during the pain it feels like more of a ache, and when I’m off it it’s more of a throbbing ache if that makes sense? I’ve been thinking about possibly trying out a mobility aid like a cane or something but I doubt I could get my hands on one… I’ve done some research and I can’t seem to find anything that matches my symptoms, and I also know it’s not growing pain like the doctors say because I’ve done my research on that too and it’s definitely just not it 💀

Well, now that I’ve explained all I can think of right now, I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts on the matter, especially if you have an idea of what might be wrong? ",2,1epcdmn,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1epcdmn/disability_help/,7,1723351325.0

How to tell Family I'm getting a wheelchair?,"So I've been struggling with mobility a lot lately. In may 2023 my L5 slipped and I started getting numbness in my legs, in july it became so bad that I had to opt for surgery. The right leg was mostly ok after the surgery but apparently the left legs nerves were damaged too much and I've had problems with numbness and chronic pain in it ever since.

I'm currently on crutches, but I can't go out for anything more than 1 hour if I can't rest/lie down. I get horrible nerve pain and it's hard to move with a leg I can't completely feel/control.

I've talked to my doctors about it and they agreed that an ambulatory wheelchair would be a good idea, so I can get out more. I already have a prescription and if everything works out with insurance I should get the chair in 2-3 weeks.

Now for the problem: I haven't told my family about it. I want to be sure that I actually have the wheelchair first, so that they can't talk me out of it. I have no idea how to tell my family about this. They have tried to be supportive about my disability, but they don't understand just how bad it can get. When I first mentioned a wheelchair as a possible option, the answer I got was basically ""No you don't need that, it's not that bad yet"". 

I think they're having trouble coming to terms with the fact that I'm disabled because they desperately want me to be okay (especially my mom). But it ends up making me feel like shit and makes my imposter syndrome worse.

How do I explain that a wheelchair isn't a bad thing, but something that could give me a little freedom back? How do I explain why I haven't told them about it earlier?

Should I file for disability?,"This may be long - 

Back in May 2022 when I was 27 i went into sudden cardiac arrest (STEMI) while driving - I had left work not feeling well and was planning on going home to take a nap. For context later, I am a full time single custodial father of a young boy. 

I went unconscious and crashed my car into a pole on the other side of the median (crossing oncoming lanes) and luckily had an off duty firefighter (same age) driving behind me who injured himself getting me out and then performing manual CPR for 80 minutes before getting a pulse back. This extended downtime causes a severe Anoxic Brain Injury that i was not expected to recover from, mentally, however, I have recovered exponentially against all odds. 

 I spent 6 weeks in the hospital with 2 of those on life support in an induced coma. Besides the ABI, I also suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury from hitting my head. 

After leaving the hospital i spent the following 10 months living with family and going to countless appointments. Cardiac, speech therapy, physical therapy, etc. 

I was off work for about a year from a company I spent the entirety of my 20s building a career at, to return after a year of involuntary medical leave to get demoted and my pay cut severely. I ended up leaving the company because of this and have found it hard to make the same kind of money i was making pre-accident. 

Against all odds im currently delivering packages for Amazon which is highly physical and is taking a toll on my Boston Sci Heart Logic Score, but im feeling physically fine and full of energy every day. 

During the year off work I also was required by doctors to live with family members until cleared for the brain injuries, I had to pay for an maintain my empty house this entire time with no income besides the measly $18k of lost wages i was able to squeeze out of the insurance company.

My question is, should i continue busting my ass for Amazon full time, or should i file for full disability in Michigan and find a part time job to maintain that. 

Would it be worth the payments and living a little longer or will i just become more and more in debt? Im still working on all of the debt i accrued during my year healing. Credit cards loans etc that havnt been paid yet.

How to help someone with a disability keep as much independence as possible?,"Tl;dr: my father is disabled and I'm looking for ways to help him keep most of his independence despite mobility issues, specifically around cooking (without a stove), but any and all tips and recommendations are greatly appreciated. (We do have an airfryer)

Hi, I'm not sure If this is a question this sub gets often, but I'm looking for help in regards to my dad and helping him keep his independence.

Over the years, my dad has had several accidents, which resulted in surgeries, which has also resulted in him losing mobility and a lot of the function an able bodied individual would have. It's absolutely deviated him. 

He has issues with his legs, involving strength and control (his leg may not move the way he wants it to), his lower back, his neck, and his arms. About 8 years ago he needed a surgery on his neck which resulted in him losing a lot of strength and function in his arms and hands.

Some days are better than others, but he's not getting any better, and it really bothers him that he's so reliant on others. I was hoping you may have some advice or some ideas of ways he can do things on his own, or products you or someone you know use to make things easier.

I got my dad a sandwich maker a few years ago so he could make grilled cheese on his own, with minimal fire risk, as he can't always make it up the stairs to use the stove, and even if he could he's afraid to start a fire when no one's home.

My biggest concern is cooking. We're not always home, and as it starts to get colder as the year closes, he's going to want ways to make warm food.

While we have a microwave for him, he can't always move well enough to make it over there, and he's a afraid he might drop the hot food and burn himself.

While him eating is my biggest concern, any and all tips or recommendations you may have would be amazing. I love my dad and I want the best for him.

07/03/2024 to 07/10/2024

07/10/2024 to 07/17/2024

07/17/2024 to 07/24/2024

07/24/2024 to 07/31/2024

07/31/2024 to 08/07/2024

08/07/2024 to 08/14/2024

08/14/2024 to 08/20/2024

What's best course of an action here, before ping pong game between HR and short term insurance vendor (in my case, it is princip$al)?

Issues with new boss and my accommodations - do I report?,"Background: I (34F) have approved accommodations for my ADHD, including flexible hours in office and up to 10 WFH days a month to use at my discretion. I average ~6 ever since my company went zero to sixty on the return to office at the start of this year. I have some helpful accommodations for in office, but it’s an open office and people are not always mindful of their volume or booking a conference room for a zoom call (a rant for another time). Therefore I am much more productive at home on most days. I had no issues - my former boss “J” was very understanding and even encouraging when it came to my accommodations knowing it was a win-win.

Two months ago my department was reorg-ed under a new Chief officer “L” who recently joined the company. She’s been ruffling lots of feathers and unfortunately my boss is leaving the company at the end of August so now I’m reporting directly to her. There have been some specific instances:

- prior to the reporting change L made some comments about my hours in office, which I wrote off tbh

- J advised L that I had an accommodation. Apparently her response was “that’s excessive amount of wfh days and unnecessary.” 

- J and I both met with L one day when I asked how J’s scope would be covered since I couldn’t take it all on indefinitely. She responded with something along the lines of “we’re all going to have to work a little more” followed by humble bragging about working late nights and weekends, and “I wish I could work from home, you know, sleep in and do almost nothing but that’s not how things are going work.”

- I requested two days of PTO for my brothers wedding and received an email from her “were you aware that you scheduled vacation during a visit from the executive chair” (A. we have unlimited PTO, B. there’s no expectation or communication of my involvement with this visit)

I’m thinking that a few of these have crossed the line and I need to at least document with HR that I’m feeling uncomfortable and pressure from my supervisor with regard to my accommodations. But I haven’t dealt with this before so any advice is appreciated 🙏🏼",1,1epcd5f,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1epcd5f/issues_with_new_boss_and_my_accommodations_do_i/,4,1723351274.0

job that pays in packing peanuts, and that I’m stupid for even trying to apply without experience. No, not experience that’s completely relative to the position, because I wasn’t employed in that time, so it doesn’t count. I’m young, I’m housebound.. I don’t know what the hell else to do.

i feel like my mom believes me one second and then doesn't the next,"something that's getting to me really bad. I've been struggling really really bad with imposter syndrome about not feeling sick enough or disabled enough despite not even being able to apply to jobs anymore without hurting myself severely, but have made good progress in the last 3 months I've been away from family visiting my partner's family.

one day she'll say me not having it as bad as others doesn't mean I'm undeserving or not disabled, and the next she tells me about one of her friends with a worse/physical condition got denied.

I'm going home today, just to find out she helped my sister (autism and depression) while I was gone but never once offered to help me despite how hard my memory and emotional problems have made it for me. i could barely fill out the paperwork myself and definitely got my work history wrong due to memory loss from my diagnoses. I had to get her to help but still got it wrong.

I feel very overdramatic saying this, but I honestly feel like it's either disability or I kill myself. even when I was working I was slowly killing myself through an ED and self harm. I can't even apply to jobs anymore afte having an extremely traumatic 2021 (family member death, getting kicked out of my life long home/state, getting abused by 2 jobs and losing them, psychiatric hospitalization, getting threatened by a family member, etc).

I just black out and self harm. I wanted to so, so badly and was excited to work again. my ptsd has gotten to a level that I cannot cope and have not been able to in 2 years. I spend more time in flashbacks/dissociation than I do otherwise. keeping myself safe feels like 3 full time jobs.

one day she supports me, and the next she is comparing me to her friends with physical disabilities like me having mental disabilities is less serious. even worse when she compares me to her ""successful friend with DID""

How to deal with people misapplying learned helplessness theory in ableist ways? ,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness?wprov=sfla1

For one, learned helplessness applies to mental illnesses like depression, so applying it to other things is outside of the original scope. 

An ongoing example of this in my life is me struggling in seeking out getting a wheelchair to be an ambulatory wheelchair user. 

When I first brought this up in 2021 to an OT when I was in hospital, I was told no OT would ever recommend me a wheelchair while I had any ability to walk because ""you might just get so used to being in a wheelchair you won't want to walk anymore."" 

I've had it as a vague goal since then, but haven't been able to put effort into finding an open minded OT yet etc. Recently I was talking about looking for a job with my support worker and said ""well, any job I apply for would have to be done by someone in a wheelchair"" and she said, ""what, are up wanting to become a wheelchair user or something?"" 

No Carol, I want to be able to work. I want to be able to go out on a zoo day. I want to be able to travel safely on public transport & go on outings with my family. 

A wheelchair would let me do things I can't now. It's not limiting me, it's giving me *more* freedom. 

Plus I want a self propelling wheelchair so I wouldn't be at risk of all my muscles getting ""deconditioned"" anyway, which is the other excuse they use. (Just prescribe some exercise to mitigate that if you need to Drs, that's not a good excuse to deny supports.)

Anyway, how do you respond to people denying supports because ""you'll get used to them and lose your independence"" or whatever? ",67,1eogc6f,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eogc6f/how_to_deal_with_people_misapplying_learned/,23,1723251572.0
Exahusting DAS Interview,"TLDR: Denied DAS after having to explain myself to three different people on the call.  
I just have to vent somewhere.  
I am so emotionally exhausted after having my DAS interview for WDW. 

I have a host of issues, most importantly for this anxiety & autism. I 1st spoke with a regular CM, then a 'healthcare' partner, and then their neurologist. They did not share any information and I had to re-explain myself every single time. I was sobbing by the end of it. They kept saying, ""It's okay, this isn't a test."" As if that was the problem. As is it doesn't take everything out of me to push past my insecurities and social anxiety to talk to them at all let alone divulge all of my medical history which hardly seems reasonable. And is if talking about my panic and anxiety isn't a trigger. 

They also start with ""What do you want me to know?"" which is such a non question and incredibly confusing. All three of them said it. 

I knew there was a good chance I'd get denied with all of the changes but I really didn't think I'd have to repeat myself in this way over and over again. It was humiliating. I can't imagine being one of the CMs who has to sit there and listen to this all day. It was horrible.

"Why are people so concerned with me ""identifying as disabled""? I'm struggling with where to draw the line. Or if there even is a line. ","My therapist has ""said this for awhile"" apparently. I just completed a program for FND and they wanted to make sure that I don't ""identify as being disabled"". 

I have to censor myself when I talk to people. I also have to ""bring my worst day"" when filling out paperwork or going to the doctor. So when I use words like ""I cant"" it's because I'm trying to explain my limitations to able bodied people. I say I'm disabled 
Because it's true
It's had to become a part of my identity right? I have BPD so I often don't know what identity may mean. Being disabled isn't the first thing I'd use to describe myself. But it's definitely the first thing people see. 

I am not neurotypical. I have trauma brain. No chance at having a chance. Just survival. I don't identify as being neurodivergent. I don't accept the various diagnoses because the symptoms are what I can address. But so frequently my literal inability to do something is invalidated or ignored.

I'm offended by this opinion. It feels shameful. Like it's not okay to identify as being disabled. It feels bad. So maybe you guys can help me understand it better?  Is my setting up a disability support group an issue?  Where does it end? I'm so sad right now.

One single source of truth: is it not possible to consolidate all health and medical information to OHIP so that one does not have to repeat that information over and over to every single service agency.,"I want to raise the inefficiencies in government when dealing with persons with disabilities. This may also serve other communities but for now my grievances are with the need for every government funded organization to ask the same questions over and over. Canadian privacy legislation requires that personal information be collected for the purpose of job - to identify someone or make a determination.  In the case of all these organizations they should require a GC key and access to the OHIP card to get information to determine one’s eligibility for services. For example, if you qualify for DSO, CMHA, Passport, Surrey Place, etc… that information should align to OHIP basic bio information. Then all you would need to do is present your OHIP card for the next service you need to determine eligibility. Why would this not work or can it work?

It’s strange how your life can change so much,"I’ve been thinking about how I have a condition that could make me go blind, and how I nearly had to get hearing aids for life as a child. 

When I was a child, I had fluid building up in my ears and needed tubes in my ears twice. The ENT told my mom that if he found a fluid buildup after the second time I had tubes… I’d have to deal with the fluid and wear hearing aids for life. 

And now, for the condition that has a chance at making me blind, it’s IIH, or Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension. 

As I’m thinking about it, something that you don’t even know about could just… sneak up on you and take one of your senses, or at least mess them up.

Concerns about finances,"Apologies as I am able-bodied, but I thought this may be the best place to ask this question. Any advice or input is very much appreciated! 

I have two partners, both who live separately in a different state, but very close together, E (23NB) and J (22M). J and I are both able to work, though we struggle with some mental health. E is disabled, primarily EDS but also struggles with CPTSD from childhood and autism.

The plan is for them to move in with me once I am able to purchase my passed grandparents' house. However, E has been denied disability twice, just applied the third time, and due to their age and the general lack of knowledge around EDS, we're pretty sure it'll have to go to a lawyer and court.

J and I are planning to work to be able to support all three of us. While E struggles with wanting to work but not being able to, we have no issues with supporting them financially.

My question/concern is that I don't want E to feel like we're their parents financially. Once they learn how to handle money more responsibly (they were never taught how and ADHD likes impulse spending), I would love for them to be able to handle some finances (they want to cook and bake, so maybe groceries), but I don't have a good way of doing that. I've seen on Google that an ""allowance"" is a good idea in this case, but I felt that may be condescending? I'm not sure. I work in construction, so my income fluctuates with mother nature, and I'm not sure how to set a good number if we did try any allowance.

Backpay flagged as assets,"Hello! I just wanted to ask a question regarding a backpay issue I'm currently having.

  
I'm getting 3 or 4 backpay installments from the SSA for the time that I was appealing to get on disability. Each installment pushes me over the $2,000 limit even if I have no money in my account, but I was assured by workers, and in letters, that these installments would not count for 9 months (I am currently on month 6 of the first installment)

But now the SSA is sending me letters saying that I've been over the entire year, and that they will be stopping my monthly payments and 'requesting' money back. 

  
I should have never been counted as over, if I had never gotten my backpay installment I would have been below the limit. And I spend all I can of my check every month before sending the leftovers to my ABLE Now account before the month ends. (For context, I had $1,200 before I got disability, and my check is $628 a month. So at most I can only be in the $1800's, and could only go over that if I kept money from my monthly checks, but I don't)

  
I'm going to be filling out an appeal today over this, because I'm sure its just a computer error. But is there anything else I need to do? Do I need to call anyone or schedule and appointment to talk in person about this?

Belts

Necklaces 

Bracelets on my left arm

My letter requesting an accommodations appeal,"For some quick context my employer granted my wfh accommodations last September but randomly denied it 6 months in claiming nonsense when my supervisor in a recorded training told me how my coworkers complaining about my accommodations was the sole reason for my denial. I told my employer this is illegal after speaking with the EEOC a ton of times with my employer telling me they can do what they want and that my supervisor misspoke… he told me this over many conversations so there might be a bigger problem if he misspoke that many times. 2 of the reasons for denial was some short project I completed within a week with one of them being moving medical charts solely to put a lounge in our tiny spider infested office that has about 10 people working out of it.

I do want to include that I was told by my hiring director that I am a personality hire and my employer has made it very clear over the last year that they desire my fun and infectious in office presence which is somewhat flattering but none of these reasons should determine that my health is not important. My most recent accommodations meeting the HR person was smug asking me invasive medical questions trying to catch me being able bodied which is why I included that last part that seemed a bit aggressive.

I don’t talk all corporate/professional and always share what’s on my mind with my employer so please excuse the informal tone. Do you think I checkmated them with this email? Whether they approve me or not I’m definitely taking legal action for denying my accommodations under false pretenses and forcing me to come in office for 6 months causing a decline in my health status.

———————————Letter——————————-

Good morning,

I will not be signing the document and requesting an appeal due to some changes that have happened regarding the denial reason on the Reasonable Accommodation Request Form. 

The first reason for denial I would like to address is my covering the receptionist's lunch on Fridays from 12:45 pm to 1:15 pm as well as providing emergency coverage if the receptionist is not able to cover the front desk from 12:45 pm to 5:00 pm on Thursdays and Fridays. Due to my workload, I expressed concern to (Supervisor) and he reassured me that he would cover my reception emergency coverage since I would become very busy beginning Monday, August 5th running to Friday, June 6th. I would also like to note that the reception schedule has not changed from the time it was developed in August of 2023 to the day I write this email meaning that reception was not an actual issue when it came to my medical accommodation denial.

The second reason for denial is to prep the clinical staff welcome boxes. It took me a full week to order the materials and put the boxes together and as I am writing this email the boxes have been finished for some time and have put these boxes in a vehicle for transport to the school sites so they are officially out of my hands till next year late July.

Something that was not mentioned in the denial letter that was brought up in the accommodation meeting was the breakdown of my program charts. I have completed both the breaking down and the archiving of my program's charts at the time of this email. I have learned recently that this project was a group effort to put couches in the office sometime in September of this year so I have informed the facilitator of this project that I will help other Program Specialists break down and archive their charts till my program becomes active next week.

Another reason brought up in the meeting was my ability to complete projects outside of my program and unfortunately from the week of August 5th to June 5th, I will not have time to spare to work on anything that does not directly impact my program since I have the largest volume of work of my fellow NorCal Program Specialists which could be confirmed by my managers as well as anyone who has access to the organization's data. If there is a need for me to complete a project outside of my program then that would need to be facilitated with the Program Director to ensure that I will not be holding up the clinician's work with the participants.

With this being said it seems that there is no actual reason to deny my medical accommodations since I and (Employer) are in the same position as when my accommodations were first approved. I will not engage in any additional conversations discussing the validity or severity of my disability, I have provided all of the information required as I did when my accommodations request was first approved without question. I have included the reception coverage schedule from the time my accommodations request was approved as well as one from this week proving that the reception schedule has not changed preventing me from approval again.

I would like to have another conversation about being told multiple times how other employees impacted the decision to deny my disability accommodation. When I brought it up in the accommodations meeting this topic was dismissed being told that (Supervisor) misspoke, but I would like to understand how he misspoke about the same thing on multiple occasions when he is my direct supervisor and is informed of the lengths of my accommodations decision. 

I would like to keep this correspondence through email.

Thank you,

I need help figuring out the important things independent adults need to or can do,"I spent the last 8 years on government assistance, most of those years housebound, and now I'm being supported by less oppressive means. I know this is a privileged position to be in and I am beyond grateful I have this new support. My mobility has also improved with the support I've recieved and I am now able to get out of the house some of the time and consider a wider range of activities.

I gave up a lot during those 8 years. Some of it directly due to my limitations, and other things I gave up because of the conditions of government assistance and the paranoia of being accused of faking. I don't even remember all of it at this point.

I am now in my 30s and I don't really remember the variety of things independent adults might need or want to do. It feels a bit like turning 18 again. The only things I can think of are making a savings account and travelling beyond my province.

I started to feel a little woozy, and since I have a seizure/fainting mystery disorder, I turned to my bf to tell him that I felt bad and I was going to go sit down.

The next thing I woke up and was so disoriented that I thought I was watching a hospital drama on tv as like five nurses rushed to my side. Apparently the nurse tending to my bf had called a code...

I was awake after 10 seconds of convulsing and had a bunch of tests done. I was encouraged to go to the ER as I had smacked my head pretty loudly on the concrete floor. I had to wait around for twenty minutes as the many many doctors questioned me about my unknown disorder. 

I'm still so embarrassed about what happened. I wasn't even a patient in the hospital and I got a code called. I literally feel mortified.",79,1enrdrl,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1enrdrl/im_so_so_embarrassed/,12,1723179917.0

The Medical System is the US is just broken and sucks,"Sorry, but I just need to rant.  
  
I had a text conversation in MyChart last night with my pulmonologist, and now I am deflated. I am halfway tempted to take the money out of my 401k, go to Vegas for a hell of a weekend, sign my DNR, and refuse all further treatment.

I have a rare presentation of a rare degenerative neurological condition - Multifocal Motor Neuropathy with Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy. But with that, I also have autoimmune hemolytic anemia, fibromyalgia, COPD, asthma, migraines, intracranial hypertension, Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, and GERD. The irony is that if I only had any one of them, I'd be OK, but altogether, I am screwed. I'm losing strength in my diagram from the neuropathy, which is making the COPD worse, which means I don't get enough oxygen for my anemic blood. I get winded speaking for more than a few seconds or such strenuous activity as walking across the room to the bathroom. My quality of life is so bad that I cannot even concentrate enough to play video games, read, or follow the plot of a TV show on bad days. I watch TV, and I lose the plot and sleep. Luckily, that's only about 20% of the time, and the other 80% I can at least watch shows or play a game for a couple hours. The nerves to most of my sweat glands are gone so I can't sweat except on my head, armpits, and neck. I have gotten heat stroke twice now from being in the sun only a few minutes on days it was only in the 80s. My cold intolerance is almost as bad. No outdoor time for me anymore.

I'm continuing to get worse, and there is nothing more the doctors can do. This led me back to my conversation with my pulmonologist last night. She said she wished there was an internist or primary care doctor who led a team of specialists in a single office that could test and treat me holistically in a single inpatient setting until they found the best treatment plan for me, but that's not how it works. Instead, the hospital stabilizes my symptoms, writes me referrals to all my specialists, and sends me home. This is what happened last November when I passed out from hypoxia during my last COPD flare-up.

I feel I could get a better treatment plan with better medications and a higher quality of life if I could just be tested and treated for ALL my conditions at once. I have an awesome primary care doctor, and he tries to provide this type of care, but he still has to send me to specialists. There are weeks or months of delay getting appointments. The specialists have different levels of engagement and commitment to my overall health. 

The neurologist is overwhelmed, and while she tries, she's clearly burned out and ends up giving the bare minimum care. She repeats my nerve conduction tests annually, tracks the progress, and renews the prescription for my IVIG infusions for another six months. Two appointments a year—wash, rinse, repeat.

The cardiologist says I have the heart of a 25-year-old in my mid-50s body. All those decades of long-distance running, and I have a resting heart rate in the upper 40s, even with my high blood pressure. I'm 90 pounds overweight, and yet I have zero blockage of any blood vessels. So, while the cardiologist is great, there is nothing to do. It's not my heart causing my blood to pool in my feet, having edema down there, or giving me my orthostatic hypertension.

My pulmonologist is amazing. She is the most caring doctor with the best bedside manner. She checks up on me monthly online between our four-month appointments. She tweaks my CPAP as needed and is heavily engaged. She is as frustrated as I am that we can't get me a higher QoL. 

My rheumatologist is a DO instead of a MD. He is certainly willing to think outside the box. He supports my daily meditation, my yoga when I'm capable, and my CBT approach to pain management. He is frustrated he can't do more. Again, great doctor who is heavily engaged and just as frustrated as me.

Pain management is a nightmare. I see my third pain management doctor since moving to Georgia two years ago. Finding a good pain management doctor around Atlanta that isn't running a scam shop is difficult. The previous two were more concerned with having me try other services they offered rather than just write my monthly narcotics prescriptions. I've tried the chiropractic adjustments, massage, and acupuncture with some success, but they insist I continue to my annual maximum of insurance-allowed times whether it helps or not. And now after the opioid crisis, the first doctor was under investigation and the second doctor refused to write the prescriptions needed and proven to treat my pain for the last seven years. Hopefully the third one will be the charm. 

My therapist is a godsend. I seriously don't think I would still be here without her. She has helped coach me in CBT, sent me to classes, convinced me to try meditation all those years ago, and opened my mind to alternative pain management treatments and yoga. 

Both my GI doctor and urologist are good, kind, and have good bedside manners. There are no complaints, but they are both secondary and just dealing with the secondary effects of my primary issues. There is only so much the Urologist can do for a neurogenic bladder and since my significant other decided my illness was all too much for her, there has been no need to treat my ED. The GI doctor just gave the omeprazole prescription to primary care and repeats the colonoscopy every three years.

The spasming muscles got so back we had to up the baclofen after I pulled two muscles in my back from spasming and the being out of breath and dizzy have gotten so bad that I can't do my yoga anymore. Primary care and pulmonology are considering sending me back to Cardiology to repeat everything (it's only been a year) just to be doing something. I know how this will go. With the delays between each appointment, it will be a few months to be seen in the office, have the imaging and tests again, have the follow-up appointment just to be told again that everything is fine.

If it wasn't for my kids and grandkids, I would just give up, sign the DNR, and refuse all further treatment to get things over with as quickly as possible. That's not what I want - but with such a low quality of life, it is difficult. 

Thanks for letting me rant. I know I'm not the only one having these kinds of experiences. I still believe that if I could get all my specialists into one room for a week, admit me to the hospital for that week, and run any test or do any procedure, they need all right there in that week, I would have a better outcome. Unfortunately, that's not how healthcare works in my country.

So time to just keep on keeping on. ",59,1enovij,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1enovij/the_medical_system_is_the_us_is_just_broken_and/,9,1723171809.0

blood work reading gone wrong [among other things],"it is currently 3am and I cannot sleep for the life of me, anyway
this post is a bit pointless. i just wasn't sure where to let out the steam to so I decided that this subreddit was the best place.


a few months ago, I think, back in March or April, I decided it was finally time to actually address my health issues. ya see, I was always the biggest kid of the class, the slowest, the least athletic and whatnot. it's not that I didn't do sports - I'd often run around the playground with the friend I had back then, I'd always participate in p.e class, and I even did ballet for 6 whole years, and contemporary dance for 3 years. 

and yet, I never lost weight. I never got better stamina, never improved my strength, nothing. as a kid I didn't think much of it (frankly, I barely thought at all). 

but now, the more I look at it from an outside perspective, the more I realise how abnormal that was. and this issue worsened as years passed to the point where in high-school, I ended up being terrified of p.e class. I went, but I didn't do anything, because I knew I wouldn't even be able to do half the warm-up without coughing up my lungs.

and nobody ever took me seriously. 

they (the teachers, my parents, fuck even the doctors) just took one look at my overweight ass and declared that all I needed was more physical activity. like, no shit sherlock, but that's kinda quite literally the problem. no one ever listened when I voiced my concerns about my health and struggles and instead they superglued a tag that reads ""lazy"" to my forehead and I can't take it off.

so, in March, after an unrelated incident, I thought that now that I'm in college, it was finally fucking time to just look for the answers on my own. and boy did I look. POTS, ehlers danlos syndrome, hypermobility, you name it, I searched everything I could find. 

then I found a new primary care doctor, and they're an angel without wings. they're the only one who actually listens to me. but as a generalist, there isn't much they can actually do, so they bad to send me to specialists.

i got a whole bunch of tests in May. a couple weeks before, I had gotten a blood work, so I also brought those results to the specialist in charge of me at the hospital. 

turns out, all my tests came back 'normal'. even the blood work. I guess a lot of you can understand how frustrating that is. 

but, like half an hour ago, as I was tossing and turning, I thought back to a funny reel about iron deficit that I had sent to a friend. I was like ""damn, I relate way too much to that, tf is up with that?""

so with no grand hope I open up Google. and boy.

turns out iron deficit can very easily be missed or dismissed by doctors. and that 'normal' blood work results are actually not so normal.

it's frustrating. just the fact that the answer might’ve  been that simple all along and people just... laughed at my face and for what? just for a misreading of a goddamn number?

it's really fucking frustrating. I've been fighting with so-called specialists for months just for them to tell me that it was a waste of time. just for them to outright ignore the whole damn thing because they can't be bothered or some shit like that.

why don't doctors just fucking listen honestly? I kinda wanna cry now from how frustrating that whole ordeal is.",1,1eoe6vj,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eoe6vj/blood_work_reading_gone_wrong_among_other_things/,4,1723245510.0
Wanting some dating advice :),"So a few weeks back at university I had a bit of a meet cute with this girl, as we got to know eachother I am completely head over heels for her in a way I haven't quite been before.

It's not that I'm blindly in love, but more so the way she talked aligned with so much of who I am, and left me feeling so inspired and in awe. Long story short she's very cool and I'm forming a bit of a crush.

She is very open about her chronic illnesses, which seem to be quite severe and impactful to her daily life, and I wanted to ask how navigating a relationship like this could work?

As much as I'd like to be ignorant and say love will prevail and solve all problems, I don't think it would be that simple. Ontop of the chronic illnesses she has also opened up about her complex PTSD.

Historically I've noticed I tend to be very much a ""caretaker"" or ""saviour"" to the people close to me and it's something I've been told by in everyone in my life I should dial down. However I don't feel my attraction towards this beautiful person is that I would be a ""saviour"" it's moreso that I've fallen for someone who also has chronic conditions and want to know if that's something I can navigate.

Disability disclosure form while applying to jobs - CA ,"I have PTSD from a trauma that happened while I was at my current job (unrelated to work), and I’m now looking for new opportunities so I can make some more money because therapy is getting really expensive, and also I just need to move on in my career. 

My PTSD can be triggered by driving, so I feel I need to disclose my disability to places I’m applying that are fully on-site or hybrid or a considerable distance from where I live, in case I need to work from home. I know this can be potentially harmful to my chances of getting hired in the first place, and also many people run into issues with their employer when it comes to accommodation/discrimination once hired. But also…I’m coming across this form on applications that says federal contractors are required by law to measure their progress toward having 7% of their workers be qualified ppl with disabilities, which leads me to believe it would actually be an advantage for me to disclose? But I’m confused because it says no one who makes hiring decisions will see my answer…so then…how does that work???

Does SSA Call Companies to Verify That/When/How A 'Self Employed' Gig Worker Worked?,"I'm new to looking for PT , flex hour, at home work while on SSDI due to mounting bills and cost of living.

I tried some surveys just because they were interesting and about my health problems. I only see LATER, I could get paid by requesting a check thru this one co's 'Wallet' ...or maybe by Gift Card...But I didn't realize it until now and technically I did the 'work' (doesn't feel like work-15 minute surveys or 45 minute webcam interview) months ago--One wallet listing shows $4.00 last Dec! I guess they add the $ up until one 'redeems it'. 

Is it too late to report that? (Do I have to lose the $ I need so badly but didn't realize was available?) AND if I can do it in the future:

[1.Do](http://1.Do) I have to notify SSA PRIOR? (I think you don't know what surveys and focus groups you'll be accepted for and payment comes later.

How to Help My Disabled Brother in a Toxic Household,"Hey Reddit,

I'm looking for some advice on how to help my younger brother, Daniel, who is 22. For context, I’m 29, and due to some family issues, I'm staying anonymous and using fake names.

Daniel has always shown and still shows signs of autism, such as extreme social anxiety, repetitive movements, difficulty making eye contact, trouble with school work, struggles with managing time, finding it difficult to understand and following spoken instructions, speaking very quietly all the time, and being sensitive to loud sounds.

During childhood, He was kept in the same grade for an extra year at school. When he was a child, he only had symptoms of facial twitches, doing the same movements over and over, and repeating words and actions a lot, like saying ""Hey it's Lesslie"" more than 50 times in a row in less than 10 minutes, many times every day for over 2 years. Currently, Daniel requires repeated instruction to perform tasks and reminders to attend to his basic needs like food, sleep, and hygiene. He experiences extreme social anxiety and struggles with communication and following directions independently, which impacts his ability to work or attend school.

Here’s the situation: Daniel is currently residing in our parents' exceedingly toxic household. Our stepfather, Kyle, exerts an overwhelming level of control over Daniel. Throughout his childhood, Kyle prevented Daniel from being evaluated for autism, despite recommendations from teachers and therapists. Even as an adult, Daniel has sought an autism evaluation, only to be denied by his father, despite recommendations from therapists and now even doctors. To our knowledge, he has not been officially diagnosed with autism. Tragically, our mother passed away in 2022, leaving Daniel without crucial support. Since then, his father has deprived him of access to his medical records, car, finances, and even his house keys.

I left home when I turned 18 because my stepfather treated everyone in the family unfairly, claiming he was ""the head of the household."" Now that I'm in college, I can barely support myself and can't afford to have Daniel live with me since he doesn't have any income. We both want to explore getting him on a disability program for benefits and finding supportive job placement.

I’m thinking of contacting my county’s regional center and reaching out to his doctors to try to retrieve his medical records. He is currently on Medi-Cal. 

Does anyone have any advice on what steps I should take next or resources in California that could help? Thanks in advance for any guidance.",6,1entu87,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1entu87/how_to_help_my_disabled_brother_in_a_toxic/,3,1723189379.0

Disability denial... AGAIN.,"I HATE TRYING TO GET ON SSDI! 🤬🤬🤬 I had very early onset schizophrenia later changed to schizoaffective bipolar type disorder at the age of 23. I also currently have another diagnosis of  Severe OCD. I have applied for disability 3 times since I was 18. SSI at 18, SSDI at 23 than SSDI again this most recent time that I'm going to talk about in this post started at age 29. I am now 33 almost 34, yeah that's how long this last time of ""applying"" has taken me. I WAS DENIED THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH. 

They have at no point sent me to see a doctor during ANY of the times I've applied. Even though I'll admit I've gone years an years between 18-30 unmedicated and not seeing any doctors so I have no documents for most of those years. They got so much information wrong on my denial packet after my ALJ hearing. They couldn't even get my mom's name right. They kept putting that if I can go shopping twice a week ""per my own statment"" I should be fine. Like I'm pretty sure in my statement nowhere did I say that I go grocery shopping twice a week. I mean we might go to the store twice in a week occasionally if we forgot something like regular ppl do but who goes 2 times every week????

They apparently denied me because my doctors who oversee my medication treatment say my medication is working for the most part. Like yeah, it makes it so I'm not in psychosis or panicing and completely freaking put every second of every day. It doesn't make me actually functioning though. It makes me barely even past the level of what could be considered ""sane"". 

I still can't get behind the wheel of a car, or even really even be a passenger when anyone but my husband is driving. I still have to check like 30 different things before going to bed every night. I still can't be in the dark or go outside at night by myself out of fear. I still feel like I'm being watched all the time. These plus tons more are still real issues for me.

I just need something to keep me going. I want to get better but it’s like the universe is punishing me for feeling hope. It’s almost comical how bad I get and how fast. I have fears about one thing, the opposite, significantly worse fear happens.

I applied for disability and I feel extremely guilty,"I mostly just want to get this off my chest. I am 23. I have bipolar (diagnosed this year), DID (noted as soon as 13, but ""official"" last year), GAD (5 years old), PTSD (13, coked hand in hand with DID), PNES (16), BPD (not actuallysure when), and some kind of chronic pain/fatigue I highly suspect to be fibromyalgia (I am on a medication mainly aimed at people with it, which has helped a lot with my symptoms. not self diagnosing, I just feel like it's just a bit obvious at this point but am hoping to get tested soonish)

some background, feel free to skip.

I'm working with my dr to figure out physical issues, as i was neglected as a child and had a relapse of a birth defect that was never fixed (cubfoot). after taking a year off after high school I started working, and after that my physical and mental health has severely declined. I have been in an out of therapy for very nearly 10 years now.

after a recent trauma that left me hospitalized last year (I got verbally harassed and threatened by a family member i was living with and kicked out. long, long, long story) and extremely stressful workplaces, I honestly can't even think about filling out a job application too hard without blacking out and some pretty gruesome stuff happening.

everytime I tried in the past almost 2 years now, (s/h) >!I blacked out and ""came back to"" with my legs, arms, and torso covered in cuts.!< while I was working I developed an ED, s/h addiction (with no previous serious s/h attempts), and was on the verge of suicide every week or so. the only thing that kept me from actually attempting was my severe fear of failing and ending up hospitalized.

I've probably seen 15-20 different therapists. a lot were while in an intensive out patient program. a lot dropped me bc my case was too complex for them. some just stopped showing up one day and they'd take weeks to find me a new one. my last therapist, a DID specialist, ended out sessions because I was too complex for her.

my step grandmother was physically and mentally disabled, but died with disability still denying her. my step dad always held this over my head, and how I wasn't ""as bad as her"" so I didn't deserve ""hand outs"" but she did. he died a few years ago, but I can still hear his lectures in my head.

some therapists (including a DID """"specialist"""")told me they wouldn't help bc they didn't believe in disability for mental illnesses. other people could function fine with it, so why couldn't I?

end of background

I feel so guilty for not working because i'm *technically* able to. I know I'm going to get denied and I don't know what to do. it really, to me, is less of a question if I can and more of if I should for my own safety and sanity. I kept avoiding sending in the paperwork bc I felt so guilty and thought if I just gave myself time and the right medications I'd be able to work. or the right therapist, but it's looking like that won't be happening any time soon.

I feel horrifically guilty for thinking I'm disabled. I've finally gotten past it a bit, but filling out the paperwork caused a lot of distress. I probably s/h'd while doing it honestly. after months of it sitting on my desk complete I had to ask a family member to send it for me because I just couldn't without spiraling.

I've very, very worried about this process and how it will affect me. by all means therapy would help, but realistically it could take me 10 more years just to find one willing to work with me long term. medication has helped with my bipolar and pain, but not the black outs and other stuff. it's extremely stressful. I feel so, so much guilt for not just working.",15,1eng5ak,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eng5ak/i_applied_for_disability_and_i_feel_extremely/,9,1723148206.0
My mum got mad at me asking for a wheelchair ,"Okay, so this happened today and it made me feels like shit.

I've recently been using my desk chair (it's one of the ones on wheels) to get around, and it's helping a lot, but I realised it would be a lot easier to use a wheelchair.

So I told my mum, ""hey, I think we should look into getting me a wheelchair""

And she got super weird about it. She asked me if I was serious in a super condescending tone (it sounded like she was gonna laugh) and when I said I was, she told me we needed to ""look into what's wrong with me"" and got super mad!

We've already been going to doctors and that, including a physician for physical therapy, but even if I get a diagnosis it wouldn't be an instant cure! I told her this, and said we should look into stuff that would help me NOW too.

She just brushed me off!

I'm 15, so there's no way for me to get one on my own, and most days I can barely make my muscles get out of bed! They're just too weak and  it's too much effort, and it's not made any easier by the fact that my antidepressants have stopped working.

Should I try for disability or no?,"So I have multiple health problems. My main one being my spine. I don’t know how to pronounce or spell it lol. When I was 15/16 I was in so much pain I could barely move and it hurt to breathe because of it. My family kept telling me “walk it off you’ll be fine” “you have to move around or it will just get worse” finally a week into being in excruciating pain I told my mom in tears that I needed to go to the hospital. They did X-rays and gave me a muscle relaxer. The muscle relaxer helped almost immediately and I felt like I could run a marathon. They came in, sat down and told me that basically my spine wasn’t attached and my tailbone was being pushed out of my back. They said they usually only see this in cheerleaders, and I was not a cheerleader. They originally said it was caused from cracking my back so much because that’s the only thing they could think of. They sent me to a spine specialist and I got an mri and more X-rays. They really didn’t do anything for me they just told me to call back in and make an appointment if my symptoms got worse. So about two years later after nothing getting better with pt and feeling like I was going nowhere, I called and made an appointment. They gave me a new specialist and he did X-rays and an mri. He pulled up my imaging and was comparing it to the last ones I had done and saw that I’m missing a bone between my tailbone and spine. So it was not caused by cracking my back I was born without a bone. 

Being told that I was born without this bone really made me start thinking back. My whole life I couldn’t stand in one spot for long periods of time and I couldn’t lay on my stomach for very long. My pediatrician always said “your back muscles must not be strong enough” but now we know it was this causing it. 

With all that being said I was told I am not disabled because surgery could fix the problem. Personally I don’t want spine surgery at 19 years old. The surgeon I saw also said he wants to push off surgery for as long as possible. So I have no choice but to work. I finally decided to try it out this year. I got a job at Walmart and I started on June 5th. With every day standing on the concrete floor I can feel my spine getting worse. I’m 3 months in and considering quitting. I’ve looked and looked for a desk job or a remote job and I cannot find anything I can do. I don’t think I can hold on much longer with Walmart. 

Now my problem is I don’t like the idea of going back to not having my own money. It scares me so bad. I can chance it and try to fight for disability but I was told I’m not disabled. I’ve been stressing over what to do for almost a month now. 

I also have severe ibs, uncontrollable migraines, (undiagnosed) social anxiety, I have a problem with my liver and spleen, inappropriate heart rhythm, and I’m on about 12-14 medications. 

I’m lucky to go one day without being in some kind of pain. I’m lucky to go one week without getting a pinched nerve and being stuck in bed all day. My spine problem has limited what I can do my whole life, but it has gotten so much worse since I was diagnosed. I have told my specialist this and he still says I’m not disabled. I sometimes have to wait days to take a shower. I can’t cook for myself most of the time because I can’t stand long enough to do it. Working has made all of this 10x worse.

Any advice on what I should do?",2,1enrrf1,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1enrrf1/should_i_try_for_disability_or_no/,12,1723181268.0
"For the visibly disabled, how do you deal with the constant staring?","I got a mobility scooter 2 years ago and it has CHANGED MY LIFE. It has given me my life back and I was able to go back to work.

But perhaps because I look quite young on a mobility scooter, I get stared at every time I leave my house, by every person I come across. 

I'm sure my experience isn't unique. Staring is a result of living in an inaccessible world where visibly disabled people are not common in everyday life. I know I can't control their actions, but I can control how I deal with it. So, how do you all deal with it? 

I honestly don't have the energy to even engage anymore with actions like staring back or waving or smiling since it's literally every single person I pass. I fear going past a line of people because I know I'll be treated like a parade float and all those eyes will turn to stare at me. 

As a cosplayer and alternative fashion model, I'm used to getting some attention and have gotten quite good at ignoring people but when I'm on my scooter it is relentless. I also often catch people photographing or filming me.

BC Disability help/suggestions,"So, I moved from Ontario to BC about a year ago. I had diagnosis (ADHD (was taking adderall, the only thing keeping me afloat), anxiety, depression, suspected autism, PSTD- I know for sure I have chronic fatigue though that isn’t currently diagnosed) and had been on ODSP for 4 years already. I did not realize that none of this information or my ODSP, would come with me. 
If you’re wondering why I moved, it’s because I have always wanted to live in BC and I noticed that Ontario had very quick and suddenly caught up in price. I wanted so badly to be somewhere I thought would help me feel better and heal my mind, even if just a little!! Why suffer somewhere I don’t want to be and pay the same price? After my dad took his own life a few years ago and left me a small inheritance, I thought; I can’t go out like him, I know he’d want me to be happy…so I moved.

The past year has been hell. No Dr, no disability, no ADHD medication, and worlds of struggling + debt.
I am on assistance, but it is not NEARLY enough. $1000 a month doesn’t even pay rent. I can’t work, but I am FORCED to (I can only manage 2 days a week), and I can’t make more than $500 or they will start taking from the assistance funds. I have to call and beg and explain I cannot for the life of me, find a Dr to sign PWD papers cos they ask constantly and say they will take me off assistance if I don’t have medical proof of being unable to work. 
Every day I feel like I am drowning. 

Every night I get the bad thoughts, because I am SO lost on what to do. I can barely do phone calls, and yet I am forced to do them constantly! The amount of circles I have been directed in…I am genuinely terrified of every day and any $ spent on anything for survival. If I didn’t have that money from my dad, I would 100% be homeless and probably be dead by now, if I am being entirely honest. The amount I spent to pay off credit card debt makes me ill, and those funds are Dwindling Fast, my friends. I can’t even go back to Ontario now (not that I’d want to), because all my supports from there are gone now too after I moved.

After exhausting my resources and, well, myself, going in so many circles just to be met with hysterical disappointment again and again, I am at the point where— I am just desperate for an answer, or some kind of hope. I currently live on Vancouver Island, near Nanaimo. 
Does anyone have any help or suggestions?? (Hopefully no more circles though, I am exhausted) I am all ears. Even if I have to pay just to get someone to sign some papers…I’ll do it. I just don’t understand any of this, and navigating it alone has ruined me. 

I’m so tired guys. Please help me 😭 I really hope there is something out there that I just don’t know about or haven’t tried yet, gah. Idk how anyone is supposed to navigate, let alone live in this system and why nothing is being done, this is so messed up. I am overwhelmed and my brain doesn’t work in these ways it is forced to be working.
Anyway thanks for reading, I’m sorry to anyone else that feels similar to myself…we’ll get through this. I hope so badly there’s answers for us, anything 🤞 ",0,1env2c4,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1env2c4/bc_disability_helpsuggestions/,7,1723194483.0

 My sister mocks me by saying I'm hypochondriac ,"This is very difficult to write because I (F20) was diagnosed just last year and I'm still getting used to it. I even thought about creating a throwaway account...

For the story behind it, I always knew there Was something off with me. Thing is, SPD wasn't known very well at this time so I wondered if I could have autism or ADHD. At this time, my sister said I was hypochondriac making the whole family laugh. I later told my mother many time how much it hurt me to which she responded with ""but that was just a joke"".

Then I was diagnosed with SPD and because I know SPD is often a comorbidity, I wanted to know if I had autism and ADHD. Turns out I don't have autism but it's impossible to say for ADHD because the symptoms are similar to those of my SPD right now.

I told that to my sister because she was talking about it when we were in the restaurant. Then she respond with the same ""joke"". I tried to respond but famously failed and just shut myself. My mother noticed and told me again that it was ""just a joke""...

It could have stopped right there but then a woman sitting behind us came to ask if my sister could move her dog because her husband was allergic. The second they were gone, my mother said straight out that she couldn't understand why she stayed with her husband because of how annoying it must be to care for him...

Can I buy a house and run a small business (bookshop) if my child is on Disability? (NY),"My 15 year old child is likely to be approved for Disability benefits within the next 3 months. As a single Mama running a small business in an undesirable location, my hope is to use part of his lump sum back-payment to purchase a home that will also contain our business. 

My son approves of this use of his money, is excited about the idea, and hopes to work with me to expand the business. Having him under my wing while he learns business skills is also another huge plus for his development and eventual independence. 

But I know that if an elderly person is on Medicaid and goes into nursing care, their home is often seized as a means of recovering the cost of those benefits. 

I’m worried I’ll pour a lifetime of work into our family home and business, only to have it seized if anything ever happens to me, and my children wouldn’t even have the right to sell it. 

I’m not sure my child could ever live independently in the home without me if something did happen to me, even when he’s an adult. 

Am I right to be concerned that if he’s approved for Disability, our property could eventually be seized? Or does this not apply to me because he’s his own person receiving benefits in his own name? He is currently a minor though, and I’m the custodial parent. 

Pictured: Vintage children’s books available through our bookshop. The current location is little more than a storage unit - with eight leaks in the roof, causing significant loss of inventory. I’m desperate to expand into a real bookshop to support us.

ICE prep,"I feel like it’s extremely important to have an end of life/emergency directory and a list of all your important documents and info in an accessible place.

What are my chances of getting accepted for disability benefits?,"I’ll try to keep this short. I’m 23 y/o born female. From the age of 14, I have been sent inpatient AT LEAST once every year for my mental health up to now. But I have had multiple hospitalizations during several years, and some residential care for an eating disorder several times. I have tried many medications, therapists, and have been cooperating with my care.

I also have a chronic pain/illness, but we are struggling to find a diagnosis. I have been working since I was 18, and have always had to quit due to my mental health getting so severe, or my pain making me physically unable to work. I have tried all kinds of jobs- retail, fast food, with accommodations, instacart, sitting factory job (that was highly accommodating but my pain was still too severe to continue), a physical hotel cleaner job, and a few others. I have tried many OTC pain meds, and even perscribed meds from my rheumatologist, with no luck. Physical therapy helped, but didn’t so enough. I stopped going because all the exercises I did there, I could do at home, and since I don’t have an income, I am tight on money (I have none actually).

This past October, I got to my breaking point. I quit my last job, and haven’t worked since. The pain got so bad, I was fantasizing about su*cide (which is usually what happens, then I get hospitalized). I applied for disability benefits this past march.

Now I know it is very likely I get denied given this is my first application, and I am young. I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anorexia, OCD/anxiety, C-PTSD. And for physical health, I am diagnosed with PCOS, Scoliosis, peroneal neuropathy in my right leg, and mild chronic gastritis. I have had physical pain issues since I was 16, and didn’t get diagnosed with anything until I was maybe 19.

My therapist said the SSI people contacted him, which is a good sign. I gave them every single inpatient, outpatient, and residential program I have been to, so they could get the records, as well as every ER, and specialist I have seen (gastro, neuro, psych, rheumo, etc.).

I know a lot of cases get denied. But I don’t know if most cases of people my age have the mental health history I have. If I don’t get accepted for my physical, I feel there is at least a better chance of getting accepted for my mental health issues.

But I need to know. How much should I get my hopes up? i try to keep them as low as I can. But I am desperate to know what my chances are. I cannot live like the rest of my peers- I cannot work or function like them.

Any and all advice, support, or thoughts are appreciated.",0,1en7ts3,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1en7ts3/what_are_my_chances_of_getting_accepted_for/,3,1723128275.0

Valid use of mobility aids?," So I'm autistic, but also have been dealing with chronic pains for almost 2 years now (I am going to be 18 in September.)

 Specically pains in my left shoulder and the back of my thighs, which often make it more difficult for me to stand in place for too long and long walks, as well as going up hill, I'm often leaning agaisnt walls or using a railing to walk up steps. 

Ontop of this I have been traveling more on trains specically, because I'm autistic I tend to move around a lot due to stimming,, but i felt like it was not a valid reason to sit in the disability section. Even though I'm sure I'd feel better physically and mentally having the extra space around me.

Now back to the chronic pain I have been looking at walking cane's recently hopefully to relive the physical pain in my legs and arm, but I'm physically able to walk, just not without pain. 

I'm also sort of wondering if it's not disrespectful to use a mobility aid to be more visually disabled so I'm not bombarded with the ""you look fine"" when I'm actually in tons of pain--? Idk If any of this is repetitive or has been asked before but I've been overthrow it along with other things and just want to hear others opinions.

Can anyone please help me with some advise?,"Let me start by saying that I am not trying to sell anything here. I am not advertising. I am honestly asking for an idea to solve a terrible situation I am stuck in.

Last year, my power wheelchair almost got on fire. It couldn’t be fixed, so I decided that next time, I would get a new one that could go up and down (meaning lift me in a higher position, I’m sure that many of you understand how important that is). 

And so, I created a gofundme, and with the help of many loving people, I got the wheelchair that I needed. I had to go pick it up in the States because they didn’t sell it here, in Colombia. I was so very exited. But then it all became a nightmare.

I understood (through the hard way), why this chair is not sold in Colombia: because here everything has stairs and obstacles. Truly, the USA seems like a paradise to me in that regard. 

And the thing is… I never before in my life cared about stairs or obstacles, because when I happened to find them, I would just ask for help! I never minded asking others for help, so, with my old chair (the one from the fire story), I would just get some guys to carry me up or down, and there I was! Inside of every place that I wanted to be without even thinking about it!

Now that has become like a distant dream… because this wheelchair is so, so, so heavy that carrying it up and down stairs becomes dangerous and it’s incredibly difficult.

On top of everything my car that had a ramp got damaged permanently, so getting that chair into other people’s cars is impossible. 
Literally, I have become Rapunzel. I am stuck at home and I’m desperate 😭. I can’t do it anymore. 

I have tried to sell this heavy chair here, but for obvious reasons, no one in this country will buy it.

I got and invitation and I’m traveling to USA very soon. So, I want to take it with me to sell it there, as of course, for a country with such accessibility, it’s a fantastic bought. 

I am obviously trying to sell this chair through the normal sites but I wonder if any of you guys know about a place to sell things specifically related to wheelchairs and health aids.

Truly I need to sell it so that I can pay some debts and buy a new chair that will fit Colombian needs.

Thank you so much for reading me and I would be always grateful for any selling tips! 🙏🏻💖",3,1emvouz,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1emvouz/can_anyone_please_help_me_with_some_advise/,0,1723087352.0
Feeling guilty about missing work ,"I work a very labor intensive job outdoors which is probably not a good decision with my disabilities but I took the job because it's something I'm so passionate about. I adore my job and the people I work with but I always feel so guilty when I miss work. I have to call off pretty frequently and just feel horrible about it because there's so much work that they could use help with. I feel like I'm not meeting expectations and that I should be there every day. Because this is a seasonal position I'll have to be rehired again in the spring but I'm worried they won't rehire me when there's more able bodied people out there. My boss also experiences health issues and misses work frequently, she's been an absolute angel to me and always tries to help me feel better. They've never done anything to make me feel bad for missing work so I just feel like I'm gaslighting myself and it's crippling. I want to be able to take my call off days to rest and recharge but I can't because I'm just full of guilt.

i think i’m disabled,"super long rant. i just got insurance this week so i’ve been trying to figure out where to start with all of this. but most of all, just trying to accept how things are right now.
most days, i can barely walk. i can’t leave the house without a cane if i’m going to be walking more than 15 minutes at a time. otherwise the pain is horrible and i lose balance. i have shocking pains that feel like my veins hurt in my legs coming from my joints.
same thing throughout my arms, shoulders, and neck. every day my left arm never stops hurting no matter what i do. my muscles swell up and hurt to the touch. i have permanent numbness in my right hip. i can’t feel the left side of my body as much as my right, but it hurts more(??) and numbness comes and goes in my legs if i’m standing too long in one place and in my arms if i have a flair up of pain or if there’s any pressure (like laying on my arm or sitting crossed for longer than a minute)
i just moved to a new state with my partner and our cat, and i had a job for 4 days before i almost threw up and my boss sent me home and i had to quit. i’ve tried applying to jobs in person and trying to figure out a way to make an income with no luck. i only have experience working in retail the last couple years but i know i can’t do that anymore and i’m not qualified for anything else. my physical health keeps declining where i can barely go out anywhere and my partner keeps telling me that i don’t have to get a job and to just focus on my health.
but the guilt of that is unbearable. i have never just focused on my health but maybe that’s what’s gotten me here. last year i was in rehab for mental health and i was working 45 hours a week on top of that! i was working 3 jobs just earlier this year. i don’t know how to just rest and take care of myself without feeling a horrible amount of guilt. every time i have a better day i gaslight myself and feel like my days spent not being able to walk or move at all weren’t real until i’m hit with a brick of pain again.
my partner was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 6 years ago and since then has made huge improvements and has learned to understand and accept the things he can and can’t do.
i have a lot to learn from him honestly. and we talk about these things almost every day. because a lot of my symptoms are just like how his were. and knowing that gives me hope, but i don’t want this.
i know no one does, but i can’t accept this. i don’t know how.
he wants to take me to a hospital soon, and i’m terrified.
i’ve spent a lot of my life in hospitals for mental health. over a year total from all my psych ward stays, and a year in rehab. and now here’s another thing.

Am I worth being in my marriage?,"I (27 f) have been with my husband we’ll call J (28 m) for about 12 years now. We were high school sweethearts and got married about 6 years ago. In the past 4 years, my health has severely declined and I am now well past the point of being disabled (I am still in the process of accepting this fully). I have been diagnosed with POTS, MS, CFS, MDD, OCD, PTSD, PNES, chronic pain, and several other things I am probably forgetting, my cognitive function is not up to par at this time. 

My main struggle is, I feel like I bring absolutely nothing to the table when it comes to our marriage. I’m unable to work, I’ve been bed bound about 70-80% of the time past year. I’m unable to do virtually anything around the house cleaning wise without risking a flare up or syncope (I have syncope episodes nearly every day and have found nothing to make them better). I can’t cook for him like I used to, I can’t drive anywhere, I can’t even shower without his help. I feel so incredibly awful with him working full time, taking care of the household as well as tending to me and virtually all of my needs. I do have a decent amount of family support, but they do not live with us and can’t lift all the burden off him. 

I’ve had multiple conversations with J about how I feel and he has expressed over and over again that he doesn’t feel overwhelmed and loves me no matter what. He has always been the most caring, kind, and understanding person I’ve known. Never once has he gotten irritated with anything or complained. All he says he wants is for me to feel better, let him know how he can help, and make me feel safe, but I just can’t help the feeling that he is keeping it all bottled up inside. 

I’m curious if anyone else has had any similar struggles and how you cope/if anyone has any advice for me or J. Anything is appreciated 🩶

I don’t think I can handle being a disabled adult - I don’t feel like a woman.,"I (F21) have been in a wheelchair for like 90% of my life, but now I’m in my 20s I can’t accept it. 

I know it’s lame. But I feel so out of control of my life yet completely in control and it’s really hard to explain.

As a kid and teen, you kind of expect to be looked after but at adulthood you’re not supposed to have someone wipe your ass for you. Especially your own mother.

It’s killing me inside. It’s killing me that my own personal care feels so unpersonal. For example - and not to be too weird and over share - but I dread my period every month but not just because it hurts and I’m literally bleeding. But because I can’t just feel gross alone and have privacy. 

I can’t physically deal with it myself like most physical personal things. But I can’t mentally deal with it either. I can’t do it. 

Every gross personal thing that people deal with, I have to have someone else do it. 

And it would only be marginally better if it was not my own mother. If I had my own life and my own personal assistant where I was in full control.

But I don’t have that and getting that isn’t that simple.

I don’t feel like a woman, and I really want to. 

I feel like a baby who is so far beneath everyone else my age. 

Edit: The issue isn't the period itself, that’s just one part of the story. It was 5am and most of the time my thoughts don't translate into words the best so I used the best example I could think of. Plus I didn't want to get too personal on here.

Short term disability questions,"**Brief history** – I am facing personal issues with my ex due to which I am having a lot of anxiety. And with my boss being tough on me, the anxiety is going through the roof. I am always under the threat that I will be fired soon. This has taken a toll on my health, sleep and thought process. I am always thinking very negative, ruminating about things almost all the time. I don’t feel like getting up for work or taking up any new work. I always like to delay deliverables and cancel meetings. My aim here is to take a few months off and focus on my health as work pressure is further deteriorating my health and outlook in general.

I am having sessions with a licensed psychology professional counselor who has told me that she has filled out multiple FEMA forms for different companies. I chose her as she is part of the ComPsych network which my company provides sessions with.

**Questions –**

1.      My company has 20 weeks (6.5 months) of time off for short term disability in which they pay 70% of salary. Can I ask for full 6.5 months for anxiety? The counselor says she is willing to fill up the form for full 6.5 months if that’s what I feel. The counselor has mentioned that she has filled up the FEMA forms for multiple people in different big organizations. Not sure if things get approved easy?

2.      Please note, the short-term disability is being handled by a third party and not directly by my organization. I have spoken to the third party, and they told me that I must apply for the leave on an online portal with start and end dates. The mail will go to my manager and the HR as soon as I submit. Once I submit the application, they will send me the forms to fill out which I will provide to the counselor to fill out. And from there, they will take 24-48 hours to take a decision on approval or rejection.

3.      I would personally like to avail the entire 6.5 months, but wanted to know your opinion if that is a good route to take **purely** from approval/rejection standpoint. Or shall I apply for 3 months initially and then keep extending it by a month every time till I reach the limit of 6 to 6.5 months.

4.      How easy or difficult is it to get the short-term disability leaves to get approved? The counselor said she hasn’t seen any rejection but also hasn’t said if someone took 6 months. I wanted to take opinion of people who have gone through this process.

5.      In short term disability, how is the leave paid? Is it paid by insurance or my organization? Does it come exactly how it comes in our bi-weekly paychecks, or would it be different?

6.      I also see a 12-month medical leave option which is for our company. All the company related leaves are paid at 100% but I am not sure about the procedure. I am hesitant to talk to HR directly about it. What if just before I am planning to apply for the leave (once I am decided about the dates), will it be a good idea to talk to the HR to inform her about my current emotional and mental state and in that meeting while discussing options can ask her what is the 12 months sick leave policy?

7.      What happens if I get an approval and on my return my organization fires me? Does the new company (if I get another job) get to know that I took short term disability benefits in any of the previous organizations?

8.      Any other things that I should be considering that I am not thinking about or should be worried about?

Renting while on LTD,"Hey everyone. As of the beginning of this year, I am on LTD (long term disability). I receive 60% of my previous income via private disability insurance that I paid into for several years. I am not on SSI or SSDI (I did submit an application for SSDI, which is still being processed). When I transitioned from STD (short term disability) to LTD, I was terminated from my employer (termination type was due to medical inability to return to work/eligible for rehire). My LTD was approved for 2 years, meaning I will continue receiving 60% of my previous income through the end of that time period. I pay for health insurance out of pocket. I am now 7 months into said disability. I was living in another state and knew I wanted and needed to move back to my previous city, so I quickly rented a flat virtually while still on payroll, knowing my employment might end. This was beneficial because it got me from point A to B without too much overthinking, however, there are issues with this place and I don't feel comfortable living here, plus I know I'm overpaying and with the issues experienced living here plus not working, I'm eager to move to a place that's less expensive and where I feel comfortable. I have never attempted to rent a place without a job. I do live in an area with a competitive rental market, though my disability salary is still OK. I have some savings which I've been using to supplement my income. I'm curious if anyone has been in the situation where they've had to apply for and rent an apartment while unemployed but receiving disability income. I'm not interested in low income housing, so I'd be applying alongside people who are employed. I feel a bit nervous mentioning that I'm not employed but have income guaranteed through disability, because what landlord wants to hear that especially if there are people who are employed willing to rent. Should I just stay where I'm at, despite the issues, and plan to move once I'm working again? I was trying to avoid this situation, but I don't have the emotional or physical energy to stay and be uncomfortable and feel it's in my best interest to move.",1,1emp0a2,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1emp0a2/renting_while_on_ltd/,6,1723068741.0
Olympics viewing- general discussion,"Hello all,

I’ve only come to think of myself as having a disability within the last two years. I first got CFS/ME 15 years ago as a senior in high school. I went from being a varsity rower, doing yoga five days a week, and weightlifting three times a week to sleeping 14 hours a day overnight. Since then (now 32 yo), I have worked full time on and off, and my health has declined significantly in the last couple of years to the point where I can’t hold a job or maintain my basic care for myself (eating, showering, all those things). I got my officially diagnosis of CFS/ME about six years ago. 

This is the first Olympics that I have watched while really struggling with day to day health and knowing that this is likely a forever condition. 

Does anyone else experience a myriad of emotions while watching them? 

On one hand, it really makes me feel grief and loss for what my body used to be able to do. I know I will never be able to excel at all of the physical activities I used to love. But, on the other hand, I am really so much more impressed with the peak athleticism that these games display. It’s been making it so much more enjoyable to see what peak human performance can look like. 

I’ve also watched some of the paralympics, which is also bringing up a lot of thoughts and emotions that I didn’t know that I had. When i see running events with people who are running with blades, all i can think is “oh they are just missing a limb, but the rest of their body is healthy, ugh im so jealous, i could run if only i was like them.” It’s really crappy having a condition that means exerting yourself is actively making your health worse and I haven’t really felt this level of jealousy or comparison to other people’s bodies in years and years. That said, there are also so many inspiring and wonderful stories about the wonderful athletes that I do find uplifting and heartwarming. 

Does anyone else have all of these mixed emotions around the Olympics? ",2,1emjc94,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1emjc94/olympics_viewing_general_discussion/,10,1723055117.0

Have marked he accessible toilets on the map. I'm going to pay the first aid room a visit asking if they know a place where I can maybe lay down (it's too last minute to still mail my con, they don't reply to things in the week beforehand). Going to wear my compression socks with my cosplay regardless of the fact it doesn't match.     

Am I forgetting something? Any tips for when I'm there? I've got ME/CFS and POTS if that helps with giving tips.

Mum got her new electric wheelchair and got a whole new perspective ,"My mum has a few conditions that have led to her mobility worsening over time. For 3 years she's used a rollator with a seat but in order for her to have some autonomy, and ease the stress on her joints for longer journeys/trips out, I bought her an electric wheelchair. It's helped so much already and she can do more with the young kids in our family, like zoo trips etc and also really enjoys going to Ikea again without dealing with the level of exhaustion it used to cause.

In all of this, however, she says she now realises exactly why people who are disabled and use wheelchairs etc feel overlooked and unseen because that's been a lot of her experience so far. People walk out in front of her, block her in at the side of paths, and, as we experienced today in Ikea, think they can push in front of her in queues. 

With this particular situation it affected me a little too as the guy in question skipped both me and my mum in the queue to grab a bag and then proceeded to stand to the side of me, only getting defensive about his position when I pushed our trolley forward towards the tills. He was adamant he was in front until he noticed my mum behind me and only then backed down, not really saying sorry but conceding because he knew what he'd done.

My mum said he'd basically been chasing her down the queueing area but she was faster in her chair. She was still directly behind me and I was the first in the queue, pulled to one side so people could pass to manned tills as I knew I needed to use the self checkout (which was very busy as the people there had a lot of large items) due to social anxiety. 
I just don't understand the audacity. He knew my mum was in front of him, I can understand missing me due to me standing a little off to the side but he still clearly tried to take advantage of the fact my mum is in a wheelchair and thinking she wouldn't bring him up on it. 

I knew it was hard, I have a few people in my life who are ambulatory wheelchair users and I do hear horror stories but as I don't see them often I rarely see it with my own eyes. I'm just sorry this is the way some people are. 

I know queue pushing may seem a silly thing to get upset over but the fact that it seemed like an intentional decision based on the guilt on his face/in his voice is bothering both of us to a degree.

Disabled Characters in Comics. ,"   To let you know my bias up front; I am a long time comics fan. Specifically an X-men fan with my favorite being Professor Xavier, who has off and on been portrayed as being in a wheelchair. 

  In the latest comic in the From The Ashes series of X-men, a new character is introduced. An antagnonist  on the side of the jailers, named “Scurvey”.   Scurvey is portrayed as a hooked-nosed   
and cadaverously thin creature with the aspect of a vulture who walks on elbow length crutches. Clearly both ugly and disabled. 

  Do you feel that this is an example of prejudice against imperfect bodies? Or that heroes need to be   Athletic and beautiful to be heroes?  As disabled people how does Scurvey make you feel?  Finally, do you think that s kid or teen might be reluctant to use a mobility aide like crutches so they aren’t compared to Scurvey?  I am truly interested to hear your thoughts on this.

Thoughts on disability and screen time? ,"My phone screen time is really horrendous. It’s 14 and 1/2 to 16 and 1/2 hours a day on average and it’s been like that for several years. 

I also work from home in front of a laptop screen too for 8 hours a day, obviously a lot of this screen time overlaps with my phone screen time. Generally I listen to YouTube or audiobooks while I’m working and well into the evening too, when I’m resting. It’s very little social media usage, only about half an hour a day. 

I keep seeing lots of advice on technology detox and it does sound really appealing. But with my disability I’m just not sure it’s worth it. A lot of benefits seem to relate to all the other things you can get done, all the goals you can achieve. I have an energy-limiting illness and the vast majority of the benefits are just not achievable for me. If I didn’t watch YouTube or listen to audiobooks I would likely just sit in silence. There would be nothing else. 

What do you think, is a screen time detox still worth doing or is it just denying myself of one of the few things I’m capable of enjoying? ",32,1elv9mc,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1elv9mc/thoughts_on_disability_and_screen_time/,15,1722983373.0
does anyone know what this might be? any help is appreciated <3,"For a while now i've been experiencing severe symptoms of a blood pressure drop a couple times a week. Almost fainting, vomiting or nausea, being unable to eat or drink for hours on end, only able to lay down in bed for hours until I either feel better or fall asleep. I've gone to the doctor several times because of how severe these episodes have been, but nothing shows up on the exams I've done so far, so no one knows what's wrong. I've had to drop out of my part-time job because of this. It's became so disabling that I don't know what to do.

SERIOUS I tend to obsess about worrying if I have an intellectual disability. So much so that it makes me feel awful about myself. Is this me thinking rationally or am I just comparing myself to others at an unhealthy degree?,"This post might be hard to read because I am just throwing out the thoughts in my head as they go. My brain hurts now and it does not feel at least 80% of my intellectual potential today (at least that is how I am categorizing it as I worry I don't have an average level of intelligence anyway) so what I write might not sound coherent or even like something an adult would write. Just bear with me on this.

I don't know if I am intellectually disabled or not. I am autistic and I needed services to help me get by growing up such as special education classes, so that is why I tend to obsess over the possibility of me being intellectually disabled. I managed to graduate high school (even though I was exempt from taking a foreign language class which is something every student needs to take if they are to attend a four-year university which is heavily encouraged by society) and never managed to be held back which sometimes I look back on and think it's amazing I managed to do that, but I still worry that I don't deserve to think I am of at least average intelligence. I had been told that I have a ""learning disability"" but I also know the definition of learning disability differs around the world. Where I live, it means you have difficulty learning the average way, but it does not mean you are intellectually disabled. However, in other parts of the world, learning disabled is just another term for intellectually disabled. I worry about how other people view my disability and me. I worry that I might not have been loved if I had been born into a family of people I like. I obsess over this sort of stuff so much that I will cry myself to sleep at least once a week.

I can't help but notice that people only see value in you if you are at least of average intelligence. People don't respect people who cannot contribute to capitalism and are like every other person. Sometimes I am astounded that being of at least average intelligence is the norm and how different the world would be if the norm was if the common person was intellectually disabled. Every time I hear someone bring up an ableist joke like ""This person must have a low IQ if they do this"" or ""This person is a Darwin candidate"", I tend to think that I must be a definition of that insult. It also goes to more serious issues like if someone talks about how someone has a brain with a flat surface. When someone says that, I start to worry if my brain never went through a pruning process. I also worry I might be afflicted with stuff that might be seen as unrealistic to worry about. I worry that I don't have brain activity even though my typing right now likely means I have some amount of brain activity going on.

I keep hearing people talk about how disabled people shouldn't be allowed to live. Normally they say this for people who have high support needs (which even then, I think everyone regardless of ability or lack there of deserves to live) but some people are more extreme and will say this about people who simply need to be put in a resource class int heir school days or cannot drive in adulthood. Sometimes I worry I might get basic rights taken away from me due to my inabilities. I worry I shouldn't be allowed to eat, drink water, wear clothes, have a place to sleep, have a home to live in, have friends in my life, be allowed to see a doctor if my health is bad, take medications to better myself, or be allowed to learn things. A lot of this is stuff I tend to hear people say disabled people shouldn't have access to due to their mentality that people only deserve basic rights if they have the ability to be worker bees who contribute to capitalism.

Are my worries valid? Is this something many disabled people worry about? Should I get myself tested for an intellectual disability just so I can finally have the answer or would that only make things worse if I know the exact score of my IQ? I honestly want to think that IQ tests are not a reliable way to test someone's intelligence since everyone thinks differently. IQ tests seem to have turned into something that scores someone's worth rather than intelligence because people do not seem to value disabled people.",0,1emidci,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1emidci/serious_i_tend_to_obsess_about_worrying_if_i_have/,5,1723052853.0

I’m just over everything at this point. and im 21.

I’ve always had some sort of health issues. Always sick. Always hurting. Always complaining about something.

I’ve had multiple specialists. Many tests. Imaging. And 90% of that has come back “just fine!” But something’s fucked.

I currently have a Pokémon like list of diagnoses, fibromyalgia, ibs, autism, most likely hEDS, I know I have ulcerative colitis, but doctors don’t listen. And it’s just, ugh.

I can’t function like a fucking human, I can’t move without pain. Any type of noise has a large chance of overstimulating me to the point im just “a bitch”. And the only people who understand all this is my immediate family, which has lead me to become a huge recluse with no friends.

Narcolepsy? ,"I have ME/CFS and dysautonomia for the record. I have this problem where I'll get really sleepy, either randomly from understimulation or as I get too exhausted to stay up any later. I also tend to want to snack before bed. So a secondary issue where I'm falling asleep in the middle of eating a snack.

The most disconcerting thing for me though, is that I will keep eating while asleep. Moving my hands to get more and eating it completely unconscious. And since I'm unconscious, I'm super uncoordinated and I end up with crumbs or entire cheezits or cereal pieces in my lap on the couch and in my shirt. 

Tldr; I often snack before bed and keep eating after falling asleep, and make a mess

Spite as a motivation ,"	I recently came to the realization from another Reddit post about the power of spite as a motivator and a healer. I had long used spite, but this past year I haven’t leaned into it as much. I have almost always had the attitude that if someone told me I couldn’t do something because _________ well “fuck that ima prove them wrong and do it anyways.”
	Even before my diagnosis as a young child, I had that attitude. One such story that occurs to me is when I was young I was visiting another family member and they had this huge lake in their backyard. Now from what I’ve been told apparently my grandpa had told me I couldn’t paddle the kayak across the lake. So little me decided I would paddle it almost all the way through the lake, and on my way back my grandpa came out and I told him how he said I couldn’t cross the lake but I did cross the lake. (Yes I had a life jacket.) Or something to that effect. 
Now when I look back at when I was diagnosed and after my second hospitalization I carried the I will prove them wrong in moments of doubt. First when after my first hospitalization at which I was told I had Schizophrenia (although this would change to schizoaffective) I was told I was too coherent to have schizophrenia. After that when I doubted my verbal ability I would remind myself that I would prove him wrong about schizophrenics not being coherent by writing the best essay.
Then my second hospitalization which has many things to write about surrounding it, I will focus on some of what I was told. I remember being told I’d have to go to residential school because they didn’t think I could make it through high school at home. They also mentioned at one point wanting to send me to the state hospital. In high school as I would often doubt myself and remember that I’d say fuck that I will graduate.
I feel like recently though I haven’t had as much of the I will prove them wrong attitude. Which I think hasn’t helped me much. I think it would be a good thing for me to go back to seeing the doomerish statements as a challenge because I will remember those statements and have moments of doubt often where I find myself slipping into the patterns of self-loathing when instead seeing those statements as a challenge seems to be more helpful.

Unum ,"After two months of going back and forth, Unum finally approved my long term disability a week ago. 

I’m under care for cancer. Ongoing side effects, chemo, I’m sick way more often than I’m healthy. My work actually requested that I apply for disability and stop working until I start feeling better and my appointments slowed down. I was assured this would be an easy process.

But anyway, I need advice. Unum approved my disability on 7/30. Since then I’ve been told that my case is with the finance department. Every day I’m told the same thing.

What’s the secret to get them to pay me?

"Cripping-Up, Authentic Disability Portrayal and Disabled Actors","A few weeks ago I started searching for information about disabled actors and authentic casting and portrayal and was disappointed at how hard it was to find this information, so I've created a few lists that you might find interesting.  
I was surprised by the amount of disabled and neurodivergent actors I found. Most lists included people who are long since dead (RIP), non-actors like Elon Musk (I know, WTF!), and actors where there is speculation that they have a condition but no declaration.  
I found quite a few movies where there was cripping-up involved, and some great examples of movies and shows where disabled actors were cast for authenticity. I found over 130 of these and I'm still looking for more.  
I'm going to continue developing these lists as a resource for anyone looking for examples or is simply curious, and if you have any suggestions for additions or amends, that would be appreciated.  
There's also some blurb about statistics that I've pulled together because there is a lot of misinformation, especially when it comes to drama.

[**Disability Portrayal. The Fails and The Wins**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls541946286/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) which is a list of 20 good and bad practice and I've annotated it with an explainer for each one. What went well, what didn't go so well and where appropriate what they could do better next time.

[**Movies with Disabled Characters that if remade would benefit from Authentic Disability Casting** ](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls541869888/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk)is a list that has lots of examples where non-disabled actors took roles that could have been cast authentically. It's not the actor's fault because like the rest of us they have bills to pay, but for the recent examples, directors have issues with authentic casting that maybe need to be addressed.

[**British and American Disabled and Neurodivergent Actors**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls541662041/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) are included in this list and are all checked out. They have all openly spoken about their conditions and are all professional actors (no cameos here thank you), and are all alive. I could have added names like Christopher Reeve or Esmond Knight, but I didn't which makes me thing that maybe I should create a historical list too.  
If you are only interested in [**Visibly Disabled Actors**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls541464229/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) or [**Neurodivergent Actors**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls545872590/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) then I have created separate list for each of them.

[**TV Shows and Movies that Cast Disabled Actors**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls543372245/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) came about from looking at the work of the visibly disabled actors I was finding. This is all about visible disability portrayal, whether it is authentic and relates to a story or is incidental where disability adds subtext.

[**Disability Portrayal, 101 Great Examples (in pictures)**](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls541454496/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) is more of a fun stroll through what I have found looking for examples where casting for visible disability is authentic, the storyline is not offensive (comments please) and where there is best practice in terms of casting, writing, performance and directing. Some of these have more than one image, because the IMDB pages have them, and there are some notable absences as there are no images included in IMBD, so apologies if your favourite show is not there, they just might not have published any images of the disabled actors.

Please let me know what you think and I hope you have as much fun as I have exploring the work of disabled actors and disability storytelling.",16,1elei8z,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1elei8z/crippingup_authentic_disability_portrayal_and/,2,1722940957.0

"Seeking information/advice on a couple different topics regarding marriage, disability, and income.","**Background:**

I have a neuromuscular disability, am a DAC (disabled adult child), with a rare disease, and qualify for care about 11 hrs a day, being dressed, bathed, transferred, toileted, housecare, etc. I've been dating my boyfriend online for going on five years now. I live in Maine (USA), and he lives in Scotland (UK). We're at the point where we'd like to progress to the next stage of life, however because of my disability it's very hard for me to just up and move. It's also difficult for him because he's in another country so he can't just move here and stay without going through the proper processes. I am currently on SSI (retirement) which I believe I get from my father, and also SS disability I believe. I have medicare part A and B.

**Scenario/Questions:**

Boyfriend via ESTA visits USA from UK, can we get married and he applies for adjustment of status after? What are things we should be aware of or look out for if we do this? I know we would probably be over the yearly income limit for my state, but only barely, which means I'd lose some of my benefits I assume, but it would be hard paying out of pocket I assume for the kind of insurance I need. Is there a way around this?

Is my boyfriend visiting and us immediately getting married the best way to go about it? We don't really want or have the time to wait on a long process of a K1 visa. We know we're ready to marry, and just want to begin the process while he visits on an ESTA visa. Could the government send him home before his adjustment of marriage status goes through? How long could that take and what are the downsides? Is there an appeal we could make if that happens, since leaving me without him or other care services - which might be removed if we were to marry, would put me in a vulnerable position?

If my boyfriend has money saved in his bank account, how will US/UK taxes affect him moving here and getting married? How can he avoid being taxed out the bum?

Any and all advice regarding any of the topics or anything I didn't mention but you think might be helpful for me would be appreciated.

Lastly, **thank you** ahead of time for any and all advice and help. Everyone's situation is different, ours is a bit complicated, so we're both very overwhelmed, when this should really be a happy time in our lives. So any and all help is appreciated. <3",1,1elz8xi,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1elz8xi/seeking_informationadvice_on_a_couple_different/,6,1722994129.0
Looking for Experience/Tips from Individuals With Disabilities/Injuries Affecting Their Legs,"My father in law recently had a very tragic accident resulting in multiple surgeries on his back and a significant change in his lifestyle.

The doctor diagnosed him with a grade A spinal cord injury. He does not have motor or sensory function below the level of injury. He cannot urinate or defecate without assistance (himself or others).

I am hoping to get some advice from those that have similar situations (inability to function from the waist down). 

- What helped with depressive symptoms and motivation to adapt?

- What tools do you use to make it easier? What are the resources you can’t imagine going without?

- What are the biggest challenges you have had?

- What is the best way to support him?

We really want him to feel like the man he used to feel like. We want him to know how useful and amazing he still is and how much he can do.

Bonus if you’re willing to create a short video with some advice or support for my father in law. His name is Dave. My email is limitedxsin@aim.com. 

Thank you all for your time.

I have MS, but I filed due to my syncope and the pain, as well as everything that comes with it, which is completely new.

Hi! New comer question,"So.. This is going to sound dumb, please don't judge me, but am I ""disabled enough? ""

I was born with knee caps that don't sit in the groove/sit higher up (both knees). Since 7th grade (3-4 years ago) they dislocate a lot and cause me pain when walking for long distances, or more than 15 minutes. I've had surgery on my left one, and currently use a rollator and walker to get around. I'm doing better with my left leg, but feel more secure and safe when using the rollator. It makes me feel like I can have support and a safe way to walk long periods. 

But my mom doesn't want me to be ""that disabled"". She believes I wouldn't want to be 18 and still on a rollator. It really hurt me, because it gives me support on bad days. I also feel like I can't call myself disabled because of other ableist things my mom has said about me or other disabled people. But I want to be able to find a label and community that fits me.

"allergies (again) // cw | medical fatphobia, ED ment","hi, old man returns to yell at clouds (/FoS)

i'm stewing abt my situation of being allergic to fruit (among other foods) because i'm allergic to latex again, and smthn that's been happening semi-related to it is peeving me just a lil bit. last i was here, i said that i had plans to go to the doctor and get a referral to an allergist and i ended up missing that appointment. i was exhausted bc of a 3am cleaning burst ep, my gran (who is my pseudo-caregiver and is also disabled) was exhausted from her night-shift job, and the appointment was at 9:45am,, safe to say, i was a dunce for accepting one that early and thinking ""yeah, this 'll be fine""

now, i know i need to go back and get a new appointment but smthn is kinda nagging at me and making me procrastinate. as considerate and open minded as my doctor is, thank gods, she also has a lil habit of suggesting weight loss medication as an alternative to what i actually need/want. she's nvr pushed it past the 1st ""do you want x or to go ahead w/ y?"" but it's happened more than once and ik it'll happen again.

i will give that she's not entirely asking w/out reason. i'm over 300 lbs and have hEDS + POTS, being overweight can/does make those conditions worsen quicker. however, she seemingly fails to accept the reasons why i'm not losing weight as i should be is bc a) i can't properly exercise w/ hEDS + POTS and b) she doesn't ask abt my history w/ disordered eating. i have ARFID, had BED and OSFED, lactose intolerance, vinegar intolerance, and now a growing latex fruit allergy checkbox list. if you didn't know, despite what sm claim, limited eating does NOT help w/ losing weight in the long run. at one point, before my dx, i /was/ working out and had a three week streak in my routine. do yk how much weight i lost? up to FIVE lbs a week. that's how bad it was.

(extreme weight-loss is considered to be between two to 2.5 a week !!)

but does she know /any/ of this? NO !! she hasn't asked and is only looking at the numbers on my charts /now/ !! i just started (a couple yrs ago now) repairing my relationship w/ food and working on ways to eat better; espec now that i /know/ i have hEDS and POTS, which require vitamin/nutrient supplements to make up for my bone and blood content lacking. i understand her concern, both as a medical professional and smn who is plus sized herself; however, she's not looking at any full picture.

i /will/ be making a new appointment bc i actually do need to be referred, but there will be words to be had if this is brought up again !!",0,1elw7yc,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1elw7yc/allergies_again_cw_medical_fatphobia_ed_ment/,8,1722985826.0

"Need help with ADA - Anxiety, Depression, Hypertension","I am applying for a reasonable accommodation at work, (I am a contractor for local government) at my doctor's suggestion. My doctor wrote up paperwork asking that I work a hybrid schedule due to panic attacks, hypertension, and debilitating anxiety. My employer has turned it down saying that there's nothing relating to in-office work which qualifies me for an accommodation. My doctor is stumped on how to fill out the paperwork, he told me he's never have someone's ADA denied before.

I have been suffering from debilitating anxiety and depression for the last 6 years, and the hypertension has gotten worse in the last 2 years; currently on 4 meds and I am still at stroke level BP. When I do WFH, my BP is lower, I can control the lights to take care of vision issues, and can rest when needed. My panic attacks are much less frequent as well. My panic attacks have increased in frequency in the last 6 months. I've had quite a few in front of co workers which is extremely embarrassing. When I am at home, I am more in control of my environment and it's better for my anxiety; I have extreme anxiety about work place violence and danger while commuting.

I'm not quite sure how to put this all on paper. Everyone at work sees that I need this, HR doesn't. My co workers are trying to see how they can help get this approved.

Does anyone know what magic terms I can put on my ADA form to get this approved? It's so frustrating because I have legitimate disabilities, and it just seems like HR doesn't care.

Could use some advice.,"I had a stroke almost 3 years ago that left me unable to drive, or work at my 20+ year long career. I was a field tech working on fire alarm systems. If I wasn't installing them, I was repairing them, and occasionally helping the inspection team when I had nothing else going on. For a few reasons, I absolutely love that work, and I've been holding out some hope that my ""gift"" left to me by my stroke killing a part of my brain that I would be able to get back to it. But it's been almost 3 years, and things haven't gotten any better. I only *look* better because I am actively attempting to make myself look better. I'm better at hiding what's wrong in my head, and my body. I can't work anywhere that requires me to drive to and from an office, so that means that pretty much everything in my previous line of work is a no-go. 

I can't drive, my balance is almost non-existent, and I have been given the ""*best""* gift of all: a permanent hallucination of the world literally shifting in front of me. The stroke left me with a never-ending case of **bad** vertigo, with everything included. I feel off balance all the time, I stopped driving before my doctor even realized to make sure I didn't drive or really use any kind of tools, like the power tools used at work. I have found new work, in a completely different field (Hard to have something in the same field that can be done 100% on a computer from home), and what really seems to get at me is that I'm angry just thinking of working there. Not so much angry, as sad, I guess, about the fact that I will likely never be able to go back to what I love doing again, and I can't seem to really put forth the effort needed for my new job.

Has anybody else had this happen? How did you get past it, if I can ask? I'm honestly just wanting to find a way to move on and stop being so damned bitter all the time. I would love any feedback. If anybody has questions about me, or what happened in my brain while I slept, just ask and I'll answer the best I can. I appreciate any and all advice, recommendations, Etc.

Partner has a problem with my sleeping habits,"I need some advice about my boyfriend of almost 7 years (we both don’t want to be married in general). What are your opinions about your partner having a problem with your sleeping habits? Backstory: I have chronic pancreatitis, epilepsy, trigeminal neuralgia, and hypothyroidism. I’ve been on SSDI since before we were together. We’ve actually known each other since high school so he knows that I have health challenges. We also have a 5 year old autistic daughter. Currently I go to bed between 11pm-12am (he likes to say remarks when I try to go to bed earlier so sometimes I stay up to avoid it) and our daughter wakes up anywhere between 4am - 7am everyday. Since I don’t work I get up with her. She goes to Aba mon-Thurs and while she’s gone I’ll take anywhere from a 30min-2hr nap depending on how I feel. I do the housework daily. He works from home so he’ll see me nap and wake me up. Or say a mean comment later on. He says I sleep enough and that I shouldn’t be tired. Tonight we got into an argument because I decided to lay down in bed around 8 and I fell asleep after 9pm the night before. He said I’ve always been the one to sleep too much throughout our entire relationship and that I’ll never change. And that if tables were reversed then women would be calling him a piece of shit, etc. I ended the conversation after that. I don’t have any friends because I stay home from not feeling well most of the time. My mother just died in May so my main support system is gone. I’m just lost. Thank you in advance.

Help... I don't know how to control my conditions,"I already am seeing a therapist, but due to insurance and money reasons I have to see them once a month (it's a $35 copay for every visit). 

Without making this too long, I have the following conditions:

• Autism
• ADHD
• OCD
• GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Yes I have both OCD and GAD)
• DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)
• Major Depressive Disorder


How the fuck do I help myself with all these conditions... Autism and OCD are destroying me. I can't control my actions and thoughts half of the time. I do things on a whim without thinking and even if I do think before doing actions, I still do them because something compells me too. The symptoms from my OCD are killing my self-esteem and self-confidence. I don't want to do anything because I think I'm not good enough. 

I'm not trying to get pity out of anyone. I deserve everything. However, I don't know how to manage anything. Autism is causing me to have fake emotions and think I'm feeling a certain emotion when I am actually feeling another (Example: My brain makes me think I'm happy when instead I could be overstimulated, so it leads to aggravation, short-temper, and others). 

If anyone wants more information on a certain condition and how it affects me, please let me know

I’m 19F, in ireland. I broke my spine last year. Car crash. My doctor and the hospital staff were medically negligent. To cut it short, my back didn’t heal right and every single day my spine has been made of broken glass, my mental health is the lowest it’s ever been, and it’s been low, and I gained a lot of weight (130 pounds to now 195 pounds in 4 months) and I’ve big purple stretch marks all over me that I’ll never be able to remove. 

Me and my fiancée (21F) got curious 1 day last year and decided we’d try recreational drugs. We tried weed before in our childhood and early teens (bad cousins) and it was just boring. So we tried HHC gummies, and my god, it’s the best feeling in the world. Once a week, sometimes 2 or 3 times, we take about 0.5-2.5mg of it each, I’ve never felt pain on it. I feel good, I feel happy, I’m not suicidal anymore, I’m incredibly creative and inspiring, I enjoy life. 

I’m in no way addicted to it, matter of fact it’s been 2 weeks since we had it cuz we ran out. The store is 2 hours away and just annoying to go to so we sometimes just don’t.

Tired of Isolation Advice lies,"IDK what this is, I think its a rant more than anything but I'm tired of being lied to when I bring up my feelings. I'm in a wheelchair and this has led to extreme isolation and whenever I meet people new its always like theres a wall between me and them, like theyre even scared to speak to me. I always thought it was just me but i never have this problem speaking to people online and I think anyone previously fat or ugly can confirm just how differently people sub-consciously treat you, so i honestly feel like its just the chair that scares people off at this point. My problem really is just that when I bring this up, I always get a variation of the response ""Those aren't people you wanna hang out with anyway, you dodged a bullet"" Or when I give a little pushback the ""truth"" comes out and I get something like ""Yeah man it sucks, youre gonna have it harder, but I know a guy in a wheelchair that has hundreds of friends"" which then makes me laugh because some of these people have told me im the only guy in a wheelchair they know in the past. Obviously down stream from this is dating too and its a similar story ""you dodged a bullet, women like that are terrible anyway"". Yeah man I'm really glad ive dodged all these bullets, leaving me almost completely alone, having never been a on a date with my only friends being the ones I made in elementary when we as humans dgaf about looks like this. I've tried making friends with people who have disabilities too but everyone I've met tends to care about disability almost as much as average people do, though I won't lie I've met \*some\* nice people. Usually, if they the type to care about disability, they give out the line that its just logistically easier with able-bodied people to hang out, so theyd rather not even get to know you for some reason. When you go downstream to dating dating disabled people its the same problem, people seem to want nothing to do with you (Maybe a different story in LGBT circles but im speaking from straight male perspective) Again, everyone then gives off the line that its easier with able-bodied people, as if you don't just care about these abled bodied people you hang out with or date, but they have to serve the purpose of being an impromptu care giver for you too. Most of the aforementioned guys I met up with to just make friends haven't been on a date either like me which doesn't help the isolation and feeling I'll never be loved by anyone too. I guess at the end of the day I am lucky to still have the group of friends I made as a kid which is more than a lot of disabled folks can say, but it hurts that  it feels no one else will ever care to get to know me.

Idk why I even wrote this, I just want to get the frustration out when it feels like people know I am fucked but the best they can give me is a little lie with a confident smile on their face, sorry for the abrupt end and incoherent writing structure..",9,1el3f08,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1el3f08/tired_of_isolation_advice_lies/,5,1722902716.0

Any advice for a disabled adult living with problematic family that won't stay out of your personal affairs?,"Hello! Hoping this is the right place, kinda looking for some support here, or input? 25 afab enby, about to be 26 here! POTS, CFS, Fibro, and suspected EDS, among many others.

So, I live with my parents, currently trying to get SSI and still chasing down unexplained symptoms, you know, the ordeal. I've been trying to gain independence for quite some time. Point is, actively trying to get out.

My folks have only recently recognized that I am actually, truly disabled, and not just making things up to get out of things. I'm glad they finally did, but they, mainly my mother, still treat me as if I am not an adult. Mind you, I pay for my own food, belongings, everything I own and use, but cannot do utilities or rent just yet. I have two partners (26 amab both) who help care for me and visit frequently to help or hang out. My folks do not know we are all dating due to past bad behavior at other partners. This is where the trouble starts to come in.

For a long while we all used to share my room and sleep together. This wasn't a problem initially. The previous mentioned bad behavior was directed at my last partner for staying with me, and my mother forbidding that, and proceeding to cause further issues during his (now her) stay, even when abiding by that rule. Now, one of my aunts, her sister, got divorced and had to move in with us for a while. This is totally fine, I like her, she likes me and both my partners. I even like her being here, and she isn't the issue directly. When she was younger she had the reputation for being the family gossip, but has grown since then. My mother is actually the issue here. She has placed a rule that my partners and I cannot sleep in the same room while my aunt is here, citing that she worries that my aunt will go tell their mother, my highly religious grandmother, and start problems like that. I have been abiding by this too, as it was only supposedly going to be 3 months. We are coming up on month 5.

The reason this is an issue is because they stay here to help me with physical labor that I can't do myself. And we do not have an appropriate place for them to sleep. They sleep on the couches in the family room. All of us are nocturnal, one of them working the night shift. So besides the couches being too short and narrow for them both (each of them over 6ft tall,) they are not only in the room that gets the full force of the rising sun through the very large windows that disrupts their sleep, they also get woken up by everyone being in that area in the mornings. They wake up with little to no sleep, usually in pain, and aren't in the condition to help me. Obviously I also miss sleeping with them as they both only have twin beds at their places, and little to no privacy. It just sucks. I also believe my aunt will be here far longer than stated, as they have been prettying up the place for themselves quite extensively.

So why don't I try to talk to my mother about it? Unfortunately my mother has narcissistic personality disorder (and unsurprisingly won't get help for it.) All conversations I have ever had with her expressing needs or wishes that make her even slightly uncomfortable always resulted in her blowing up and making things worse as a result. Usually full of insults, threats, or yelling. My father won't back me up either, as he won't ever go against her, and is a passive enabler. He simply won't even if he disagrees with her. I also said she ""cited"" the worry about my grandmother as her motive because she frequently will do that and have an ulterior motive that she doesn't want to mention because it puts her bad faith on display. She has jealousy issues over the people I have in my life and has said as such many times outright. She's also stated (during my ex-girlfriend's stay) that she doesn't get to sleep next to anyone (folks are separated) so ""why should you get to?"" I don't know, I just worry that there's an unsaid second reason she imposed this new rule.

So I'm unsure what to even do in this situation. I have a couple options that I can see, but none are particularly good ones. I could do what I did that allowed them to be sleeping in here in the first place, which is just doing it and acting as if that's totally normal and business as usual, which it kinda is to be fair. I could go ask my aunt if them sleeping in here would bother her, and politely ask her to not mention it to my grandmother, as I believe she'd be very reasonable about it, but even if I don't mention my mother's motive, she would very possibly view that as throwing her under the bus or usurping her in some way. I could go speak with my father about it again, but that wouldn't really produce any results as the response will be ""I won't go against your mother.""

I dunno I'm really lost. I have mixed feelings on the validity of my feelings on the issue, or right to have adult privileges in the house I have to live in until I can finally get out, whenever that is. I feel like I should have some boundaries about what goes on in my private area, but I'm unsure. I get that I live with them, and I'm grateful for that, but I still feel like I have no say what goes on in my own life.

Sorry for the long read, or rant? I just have a lot of context and complicated moving parts in all this. I appreciate any polite feedback, or advice, or simple understanding. Thanks for reading.

Edit for extra clarity: My mother does not pay any of the bills either. My father owns the house, and pays for  everything, and only barely. Even her own personal bills like her insurance and her credit cards, and personal shopping he pays for. I guess that's what really bothers me about it. It's just frustrating to be beneath someone who contributes the same amount I do. I would get it if my father also agreed with this rule, but he doesn't. He understands and agrees with me, but as stated, won't stop her. He won't tell on me, but he won't back me up either. At the end of the day, I can always just wait.",0,1elqrpv,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1elqrpv/any_advice_for_a_disabled_adult_living_with/,9,1722972466.0
I have trouble managing caregivers ," I've been managing my care staff for 18 years and I still stink at it. I have 2 caregivers, one is great at her job and the other sucks at it but he's my only friend in a part of the country where I have no family. The problem is that the good caregiver is rightfully tiered of cleaning up after the bad caregiver. I would hate to lose the good caregiver over something I should have prevented. I feel even worse that I upset the good caregiver, she deserves better than that. Now I just have anxiety when either one is working. I told the bad one I already ate because I don't want him to mess up the kitchen. My problem is that I don't expect much from anyone. Some people take advantage of that while others don't.

Recap of Disabled Voters for Kamala Harris,"Hello everyone!

This is a recap of the zoom meeting Disabled Voters for Kamala Harris that happened last Friday (sorry for the delay). I've never done a recap post before, so I'm not sure exactly how specific I should be? I'm happy to answer any more specific questions down below.

The meeting was two hours long with a five minute intermission. Pretty much the whole thing was ASL-interpreted, but there were many technical difficulties on that end with the interpreters disappearing, the squares being two small for one of the Deaf speakers to see, etc. Some others also mentioned that although there were subtitles they were very delayed and overall not that helpful. However, they mentioned this is going to be a first of a series of meetings, so hopefully they will be able to work the kinks out.

This meeting did *not* discuss policy or what we want from Kamala Harris. Rather, it was more of a pep rally emphasizing the importance of voting (and specifically, voting for Harris over the man who says he wants people with ID/DDs to die). There were two separate panels, each of whom were asked a couple of questions in regards to voting. Among the things that were discussed were the difficulties disabled people can run into while voting and how people can be aware of and be ready to confront those barriers. It was suggested that we visit the polling place ahead of time to see if it's accessible to us, voting in groups, and overall 'Karen-ing' the poll workers until they let us vote. They also discussed how to report non-ADA compliant polling stations.

Something that was repeatedly emphasized was intersectionality, and that they didn't have anyone on their panel who was Asian, and only had one man. As such, they encourage anyone interested in the panel to reach out and contact them at [info@disabledvotersforharris.com](mailto:info@disabledvotersforharris.com).

There will be further meetings in which Harris' policy regarding disability will be discussed.",3,1el6f3p,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1el6f3p/recap_of_disabled_voters_for_kamala_harris/,0,1722911250.0
Disability? mentally ill,"Im really sorry i have no idea where to ask. Im a 25f with a diagnosis of : PTSD, BPD, Bipolar ii, GAD, recurrent MDD, OCD. The only reason i made jt this far in life is bc i never had an option. I am self supporting and on top of having to send money to my family. I have a full time job (hourly $45.32) and a minimum wage part time job (CA-16$)that im trying to use for debt. One reason rn i cant end things bc i have no health insurance i cant afford due to debt so i worry that i will be found and have to suffer even more humiliation and pain since as i understand most attempts are unsuccessful 

I was on medication for almost 7ish years before eventually stopping because i thought i was finally at a good place in my life but alas.

I debated for so many years about going on disability because im not sure what else to say other than i just have a hadd time functioning especially at work. One of the main reasons i stop myself every time is bc i heard its 1.2k a month or so which doesnt cover my expenses not even close. Im talking like bills and car and debt etc. if it were up to me, i am willing to live in dumpster eating noodles if that meant i can feel less pain and dont have to daydream abt ending as often as i do.

I am trying to understand what are my options as to disability and is mental illness covered i just have no idea what to do and im desperate enough because frankly it feels like im at my deathbed .

The ableism in criminal “justice”,"I’m into true crime and I’m watching the case of Jane Bashara. She was killed by a guy named Joe Gentz with a 67 IQ (he’s developmentally disabled) and they didn’t take him seriously at all when Joe said that Jane’s husband, Bob Bashara, hired him and Bob helped him dispose of Jane’s body… because he has “the mind of a child”. Joe even said that Bob was pointing a gun at his head to make *sure* he killed Jane. 

They didn’t believe a word he said, and then it turns out, as they investigated more… Joe was right.

I tried to point out to my mom that they were being ableist, but she refused to see it. They were trying to use him as a scapegoat and everything. I hope the police felt like assholes when they realized Joe was being honest.

Things are looking better and worse ,"
I have constant pain in my entire body. My knees give out regularly. I get vomiting spells, severe constipation. It hurts to pee and I get regular UTIs. I get horrible headache and migraines.ive had seizures in the past. I can't sleep well or lift anything. I have a irregular period my cycles (30-70 days) I also have bipolar and autism.

I've been dealing with all this for a long time and managed to get help hear and thare but it's very difficult to get doctors to take my pain and other issues seriously. 
I very recently have managed to get a lot of care for these long term problems.

I have a psychiatrist, PCP, urologist, dietitian, physical therapist, neurologist, and a GURD Dr.

My psychiatrist is pretty good as well as my PT. My PT has had me bring things up to my PCP and she puts in referrals that take months or years.i got my urologist 2 years after I got put on the wait list. He is good I guess. He put in a standing order for UTI testing so I don't have to go to urgent care.

My dietitian is nice but ineffective. She makes suggestions and recommendations that I just can't afford to follow though on. I am living Off of my SSDI and my boyfriends small paychecks. I've tried explaining this but I guess she just doesn't get it. 

My GURD Dr. Just straight up gaslights me. Downplaying my systems and saying I'm probably just stressed. He as implied that I'm just being dramatic on multiple occasions. But I've gone a month without pooping before. He doesn't offer any solutions he just tells me I'm fine. 

I just got a new neurologist I've only seen him once and he got more done in 1 visit than my previous neurologist got done in 3 years. 

I'm on wait lists for rheumatology, therapy, orthopedics, a medical breast reduction, and the fertility clinic. 

Even though I am getting care more than ever before I'm still in a lot of pain and struggling in life. I have been struggling with my PT exercises at home became of my pain just being to severe. I can't have a real social life because of my pain and lack of a license. I just see family and my pets. I talk to some of my friends online and I see them once a year or two. 

It's just hard especially since no one around me really gets it. My dad does and I talk to him on the phone every once in awhile but he lives on the other side of the country.",1,1elb49r,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1elb49r/things_are_looking_better_and_worse/,0,1722927468.0

Aitah,"So just to start off, I have disabled family members, friends, co-workers, partner and now I work exclusively with Adults with learning disabilities.

My friends that have little to no experience with folk with disabilities think I'm awful for saying this so I want to know your opinion.

""People with disabilities can be assholes too.""

They say things like ""you can't talk about disabled people like that"" or ""don't say something so awful"". What is your opinion on this? 

My stance is,  just because you have a disability does not mean you can't do or say awful things. 

For example, there's a women who uses a wheelchair where I live and she is so rude, mean and awful to everyone around her and she abused her dog to the point where it had to be taken from her. I have been nothing but, kind, understanding and helpful to this woman but yet she still says some truly horrible things to me. She only has a physical disability and is fully aware of her actions. She's an asshole 100% but I can't say that as she's in a wheelchair? 

Anywho, that's just example, what are your thoughts?",23,1ekku6q,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ekku6q/aitah/,37,1722855310.0
AITA for leaving a group because someone had autism?,"I (now 21F) was in an anime club hosted by my college a couple years ago. The first year in it was good, I got along fairly well with most of the people and even went to a convention (my first ever anime convention at that). I had a blast and planned on joining them the next year despite being close to graduating thanks to college classes I took in high school.

During the first convention there was an guy (M unknown age) with autism that I didn’t exactly like but was willing to be civil with. He wasn’t someone that required around the clock support and could have regular conversations with but I figured we just weren’t people that would be friends. However, he had a tendency to try and get me annoyed by doing a ridiculous Irish impression *constantly* and only one person (age and exact gender unknown) in the group could make him stop.

It turns out he kept himself managed because of that person and when they left he became a lot worse. He was constantly “play” fighting with two of the other autistic guys (both of which I get along fine with) so roughly that they had to ban it or risk getting kicked out of the group with some other restrictions that honestly made the group a bit dull.

What makes it worse is that I’ve seen him completely keep himself from doing anything “weird” when with his mother. While I’m aware of masking (ADHD diagnosis for myself) it’s infuriating to me that he can’t at least acknowledge that when asked to stop doing something he should apologize.

I did end up going to the second anime convention with the group despite this and I wish i hadn’t. On the last day, right before a group picture, he stole the glasses from another group member who uses a cane. I offered to get them back and had to grab his arm to try and reach since he is quite a bit taller than me. He grabbed me back and squeezed my arm so hard I started to cry (admittedly my pain tolerance is low but I bruised and had to get an ice pack wrapped against my arm).

This was my last straw, so when we came back home I stopped visiting the anime club. I saw some of the members that were in other clubs, and even got a message about his actions and what was changing in the future. However, I can’t bring myself to go back.

Edit:
I would like to say that he explained his actions away using his autism for an explanation. I’m aware there are different levels of autism, such as needing full support due to being unable to speak and/or read without assistance, and was concerned I just wasn’t aware what his needs actually were after seeing him acting so differently around certain people.",55,1ekgj8d,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ekgj8d/aita_for_leaving_a_group_because_someone_had/,39,1722837727.0

I feel EXTRAORDINARILY hopeful for the first time since 2018 and it's making me off balance. ,"I have been having between 1 to 3 spine surgeries a year for the past six years and unknown pain before that. I just had a surgery two weeks ago and I'm hopeful it's working. Most things on my body have to been done bilaterally, so it's likely the shifted pain to my right side will have to have surgery in the next year or two. But right now, the pain on my left side is down for the first time in six years. 

I'm dreaming about all the things I used to do when my pain was lower, meanwhile I'm on mostly bedrest recouping from surgery for at least the next 6 weeks for fusion to begin. My pain will never be zero, but lower was the goal for this surgery. And lower seems to be accomplished. 

It's 3 months before I'll be able to really feel a change and 12 months until imaging confirmation. But that's seems like nothing for a problem that started in 2008 and wasn't figured out until 2018.

23F seeking to gain independence from toxic relationship ,"Hey everyone! I recently made a post about being in a tough situtation, here’s the link to that post: https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/s/dU3xcro2kS

(tldr: in a toxic relationship, no support outside of him, needing to gain independence to possibly break up) 


I’ve concluded that I need to start putting all of my spoons into gaining as much independence as I can, however that’s really hard with my situation. I’m so disabled currently that I can’t really drive, and I have absolutely no friends or family whatsoever that can support me. 

I’m seeking any resources, advice, or information on how to gain as much independence as I can. Currently, my boyfriend is my only source of financial support, and I would be homeless without him. I am also seeking advice or resources on ways to build my support circle. If I do end things with my partner, I will have absolutely zero people in my life. 

I am looking for any ways to make money within my ability, any online jobs, any legit resources for disabled people, or any hacks or ideas I haven’t thought of. For a little more context, my disabilities limit my ability to focus, be around others, and leave my home more than once a week or so. I have:

 • PTSD  
• Panic disorder
• generalized anxiety disorder 
• Major depressive disorder 
• Autism 
• Chronic fatigue syndrome 
• Auditory processing disorder 
• sensory processing disorder 
• Insomnia 
• Misophonia 

My disabilities are so bad that many days I feel like I’m just straight up dying.

I can not drive and rely entirely on Uber or my partner for any transportation. 

I am currently waiting for my disability case to be approved, and have been waiting for over a year now with no sign of anything yet. And yes, I’m in therapy but my partner pays for all my sessions. 
 I should also add that due to my disabilities I have not had the change to obtain a college degree. 

If anyone has any words of advice, resources, or ideas, I’m open minded! I am in a very very difficult place right now. ",10,1ekkvbt,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ekkvbt/23f_seeking_to_gain_independence_from_toxic/,18,1722855436.0

If they invite you in, do you tell them in advance, “Hey, I use a walker and a captioning device since I’m hearing impaired”? I don’t see myself leaving a fully-remote role for a “hybrid” one but may take the interview just for practice.

Advice on getting Medicaid to cover Mobility aids,"So I have Medicare and Medicaid. I guess it's whatever the first insurance doesn't cover, the second will pick up. I'm also on disability and unemployed so my income is very limited. 

So far I've been able to afford the cane I needed since they wouldn't cover it and the wheelchair I had to save up for a wheelchair ($145 Drive Blue Streak) since insurance wouldn't cover that either. Weirdly they didn't say they wouldn't cover it because it wasn't for indoor use specifically but the woman at the pharmacy said it's because they rarely cover wheelchairs for people who aren't elderly or bed ridden. I also found my Nana's old walker that I've using but it's really bad quality since it was got to just get her through a two week stay at our house. 

These things get me through fine but my wheelchair is so bulky and heavy it tires me out just getting it around and my doctor recently prescribed me a rollator since I was just diagnosed with POTS. 

I have Fibromyalgia, CFS, and POTS and I'm wondering if that's why I'm having issues with getting insurance to accept the prescriptions. The pharmacy I was going to go to as well was wanting to charge me $250 just to rent a transport wheelchair (not the kind I need) and IF medicaid approved it, I'd be reimbursed $99 for the transport wheelchair I have no use for. So I'm trying to see about getting Mobility aids myself and billing insurance to get them to cover it that way, if it can work that way. I'm not sure, I'm very new to this all having just been diagnosed in January and only a couple weeks ago did I find out that insurance tends to fight you on it when it comes to coverage.

My questions are:

How do I even start?

How do I know if they'll cover specific mobility aids? Like what if they don't think the brand is reliable and choose to deny it? How do I prevent that?

Is there like a budget I should stay in for these things? Are there ones they would deem too expensive for my needs?

Sorry for all the text and questions. I'm really new to this and I have autism and learning disabilities so understanding all this stuff has been so hard for me so help would be much appreciated! I'm just mostly overwhelmed on where to even start.

Edit : Wanted to add this since my comments and post are getting down voted, my doctor it seems like has zero idea on what the process is for getting mobility aids. From what she's been saying, it made it seem like I just bring script into a specific pharmacy and it would be just filled there like any other script. 

I joined this sub because I have been disabled due to severe mental health issues since I was 15 but I have only had mobility issues since January of this year. I have no one who knows what they're doing on my care team honestly and I'm still even going through the diagnosing process. I just got diagnosed with POTS a few days ago and we're still suspicious I have early stages of Rheumatoid arthritis even though I tested negative (my grandma has it and tested negative too) so I'm still figuring things out. 

I know this stuff may be common sense to many who have dealt with being physically disabled for longer than I but I am basically on my own in all this and trying to figure it all out without any idea how the system works. I know this edit will come off as sensitive and I'm not trying to come off as if I'm genuinely upset, because at the end of the day it's the internet it's not that deep, but please be mindful that not everyone has had the same resources you've had, and that includes education, knowledge and support. 💕

Embarrassing reason why I cannot get a service dog,"My health is declining, I have a part-time caretaker. But I want to be more independent with daily tasks. I have also a life-threatening disease and I've read there are service dogs that can detect low blood pressure, which would allow me to emergency-inject solu-cortef and the dog have a way to call paramedics if I pass out.

I also have a son. I do get help taking care of him, but not financially. I'm on SSI because of my disabilities. So money is always tight.

I know there are helpful organizations that I could probably work with to get a service dog.

The problem: monthly expenses for the dog, including but not limited to vet, medications, food, toys, shelter, bed, various things like ropes and stuff to help me perform tasks. 

I just can't afford it. I'm really bummed. 

This illness is going to be the death of me.

And I've looked into smart watches for blood pressure - apparently none of them are very accurate. Not to mention my declining physical state.

I am venting, I'm sorry, I just wish I could have one.

(I have experience with extensive training of a couple dogs in my pre-disabled years)

Edit: Why did I get downvoted? I am just being honest, I'd love to be less likely to die fron my disease thanks to a service dog. It's not like I'm being a jerk or something.

My parents (65 & 70) and I can no longer fund my sister's (29f) nursing home care. ,"My (30 female) sister (29 female), “Sarah”, was born with Prader Willi syndrome (PWS). PWS is a rare genetic issue that results in a variety of cognitive and physical disabilities . For example, Sarah struggles with mobility and fine motor skills. While she can walk and talk, she met these milestones much later on than other toddlers. She also faces challenges with intaking and processing new information and skills. She struggles with behavioral issues as well. Most individuals with PWS require such intensive medical and behavioral support, they live in residential facilities in adulthood. The medical and physical issues that come along with PWS are so severe, many of those with PWS do not make it into their 40s. 

Because of the severity of my sister‘s disability, she has been collecting Social Security, as well as being on government health insurance (Medicaid) since she was a young adult. When she turned 18 my parents obtained legal guardianship over her because she will need constant care. Having a child with special needs is extremely expensive. Over the decades, my parents always managed to make ends meet. Now that they are in retirement, they are on a severely limited income themselves. Luckily, I make decent money so I have been able to help them out financially especially as I entered my mid 20s and established myself in my career more. 

In 2021 Sarah got incredibly sick. She developed a respiratory issue where her lungs were producing too much CO2 and not enough oxygen. She almost died. At the hospital, the doctors gave her a trach and put her on a ventilator. Her condition slowly improved over time. She still has a trach, and only uses the ventilator at night. The doctors were very clear with us that it would take a while to transition her completely off the vent, and we could be looking at a timeline of a year or longer before she was ready to come back home. 

After Sarah had been at the nursing home for about six months. my dad mentioned that her state insurance was no longer covering the full cost of the nursing home and they were getting billed for a couple hundred dollars a month. I offered to help them with these, which my dad accepted periodically. But, they weren’t telling me the full story on how quick these bills were piling up. Earlier this week, my dad called me very stressed out. Apparently there’s an outstanding bill from the nursing home for $15,000. Apparently the the bill has been steadily rising and my dad was hesitant to ask me because I’ve already helped them quite a lot this year. I make a good salary but I cannot cover $15,000. Even covering half of it would be a serious hit to my savings. 

My dad was particularly upset because the nursing home’s billing department had gone into my sister‘s room, asking her about the outstanding bill. Sarah has the cognitive functioning comparable to that of an 8 year old. My sister barely understands the concept of bills. Sarah had a meltdown. My dad was thinking of taking out a loan on their house to pay for this. I told him to pause. Instead, I have connected him with some organizations and nonprofits who offer a combination of financial aid as well as legal/advocacy services for caretakers of those with severe disabilities. I have also connected him to their local state rep and state Senator, who can hopefully provide some insight into additional state resources.

He is following up on those contacts, but I thought that I would come here as well. There’s the immediate question on how to handle the current $15k outstanding medical bill. I was wondering if anyone else on this thread has experienced similar issues with funding residential care for adults with special needs and are familiar with any resources you could point us to… grant programs, financial aid, etc.

This experience also illuminates some bigger- picture questions about how to finance my sister’s complex medical needs long term. I was speaking with a colleague who also has a sister with severe special needs. She was shocked that we were still trying to pay these costs out of pocket. She explained that, when her parents died, the rest of her siblings explored their legal options and found out that if their sister was made a ward of the state, she was eligible for the state to provide better medical care (as opposed to her siblings having to fund it out of pocket). However that varies state by state. We live in Illinois.

My parents and I are now wondering if we should re-asses my dad having legal guardianship over my sister. I don’t know how much longer we can continue to keep up with her costs. I don’t think I can fund nursing home care for her as well as support children of my own once my parents are gone. 

So, the second part of my question is if anyone here has knowledge about guardianship status of adults with special needs and how that intersects with the state vs. the parents having the responsbility to pay such costs.

I will also be posting this on a couple of legal subreddits. I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this.",84,1ejxtqy,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ejxtqy/my_parents_65_70_and_i_can_no_longer_fund_my/,25,1722785156.0

The Period From HELL With PCOS: Bleeding For 170 Days & Counting,,0,1ekq1vx,disability,https://youtu.be/QKT0aP3ktQU,0,1722870153.0
Someone told me last night that they're more disabled than me so I should help them,"I don't even know what to do with this, they're literally not disabled they just won't do their physical therapy so  it's becoming a chronic condition.

They never help me and make things difficult for me.  Now they want me to sympathize with them and be their caregiver when they denied and continue to deny me one.

It's like the entire time since the accident they simply don't believe I'm disabled even after watching me go through the absolute torment of over two hours of nerve conduction tests because the doctor tried to make it out like I was faking too so I got tested **extra thoroughly**.  If any of you know how those tests work, they jab two probes like knitting needles into your nerve centers and chase it with the needles down the path of innervation. 

Yes, if your connection to your spinal cord is gone, there is no pain.  It just feels like pushing...

When they are probing to find the edge of the damage, it's, again quite literally, jamming a giant sharp probe down into your body to hit the nerve centers - PAIN.  PAIN is what they use to test if you are really disabled.  

You **WILL** scream.  I passed out a couple times, but you have to be awake and your nervous system fully unimpaired, so you get no numbing, anesthesia, etc...

They brought in another guy to supervise the tester because he thought he was doing it wrong (he wouldn't say but DUH), then they brought in a guy to supervise the guy that was supervising to make sure the equipment was working right.  Because I wasn't screaming when they thought I should be.

They were there for that, yet they still tell me to my face that I'm faking it and I don't need any help, that I am ungrateful for the food I get and the little bit of clean space I can have.

How can someone you love watch you scream for two hours and still dismiss you?

Please tell me it's going to get better.  Please tell me there's an after.  I just want to give up and the pain to stop.  I don't want to stop fighting for my abilities but it seems pointless with all the obstacles constantly presented me...neglect, abuse, ""unintentional"" harm, I'd say I can't take it anymore but I know I have to.

Every day is just making it through all the things they throw on me to try and break me further.

I don't know what to do and there's nothing you can say that will really help.

I need help and there isn't going to be any.  I have to figure this out on my own while still being constantly dragged under by selfish people with no empathy who claim to love me but throw down when there's no ""extra money"" while complaining that everything is on a payment plan and sorry we don't have enough for food for you.  I have to ask when people come home (I can't leave but they can) if they have any leftover food or whatever they don't want.

I got yelled at for trying to clean up my area yesterday afternoon because people that work odd hours and don't give schedule or pay any bills but buy themselves ebikes, cars, and high end PC computers somehow had to suddenly be in bed at 9pm on a saturday night because they have to work at 4am on sunday...wtf.  I can't stand up for myself because it gets me threatened, ignored, or the next week will be MANY random obstacles that just HAPPEN to completely obstruct the walk way and I can't step over nor hardly walk in the first place.  Passive aggressive harm is still harm, just because you did nothing doesn't mean you're innocent.  Yelling ""I never said that"" while I'm trying to explain how I feel like you hate me because of the way you TREAT me, NOT what you SAY.  Your behavior is your words yet everyone else is held to task; what about this and that, never any actual discourse leading to solutions - only invalidation and control.

I guess it is just a rant, after all.  If anyone has actually read this or cares, I will feel a bit better.

Requesting work accomodations? Am I disabled enough?,"Currently I work as a contractor for my current company. Though they have a strict hybrid policy, I don't have to abide by it because I'm contracted. I have numerous minor conditions that make working in person difficult. Pre-covid, Id have to take off 2-3 days each month because of it, but otherwise worked in-person (though it sucked.)

I have a fragrance allergy that makes it difficult to focus, strong fragrances give me asthma attacks but that I can avoid by moving spaces unless there's a PARTICULAR person causing problems. I've had IBS my whole life, can bring a heating pad in for that.

Please help me,"I don't know what do to, I'm just so lost. I (21f) was diagnosed with fibromyalgia earlier this year. My mother has the same and was abusive while I had to ignore it and care for her anyway, and now I'm seeing so much of it in myself. I snap and get irritable when I'm in pain or tired, I've had to apply for PIP for the first time and it's ruined me mentally. I was made redundant recently from my desk job which was still hard to manage but was the best I was going to get, and now I'm struggling to find anything I can handle while my boyfriend and his family are trying to be supportive but still putting pressure on me every day to find something to keep money coming in.

My whole family always called my mother lazy, self-absorbed and manipulative. She was all of those things don't get me wrong, but it was Her not her disability. They all blamed the fibromyalgia and now I feel like they won't take me seriously either even when I'm in both physical and mental agony. I've been screaming for help, from anyone, but it's like I don't exist.

The guilt of just existing with this condition is eating me alive. I pull muscles and trap nerves so often my boyfriend has learned how to wash my hair for me since I often can't move enough to do it myself. I know he doesn't mind, but I minded doing it for my mother and never said otherwise. I can't stand thinking I'm making him feel the way I felt. I've also decided to never have children because 1. my body cant handle it anyway and 2. i refuse to traumatise them with my own pain.

I'm 21. I should be out enjoying the summer sun, doing brunch with my friends, going swimming at the beach. Instead I haven't left my house in a week and am constantly 🍃 just to cope.

I've referred myself back to therapy for both the condition and some recent events that haven't helped. I just want to be seen. I want people to tell me they understand and that I'm not going crazy. I know logically I never asked to be made this way, but damn my life was never meant to be this way. I was never meant to give up dance despite it being my first love and my first identity since I was 4. I was never meant to consider a wheelchair just to go shopping.

I've never lost someone (when I was old enough to understand, anyway) but I imagine what I'm feeling is grief. I'm literally grieving the life I am currently living.

Disabled son needs medication for his chronic illness but he refuses to go to the doctor and telehealth won’t treat his condition. Looking for ideas.,My son (20) is severely autistic. Unfortunately due to his physiology he also suffers from chronic inner ear infections. He gets them at least once every month or two and the only thing that cures them is a full course of antibiotics. The problem I’m having is that when he’s in pain he expresses it by acting out behaviorally. He absolutely refuses to go to the doctor. I’ve tried doing telehealth which would be great but ear infections is one thing they have to be seen in person for. So I’m at a complete loss here. He needs antibiotics to get better but refuses to go see the doctor to get them and that’s the only way to get them. It’s a catch-22.

"Severe flair from getting a tattoo (eds, pots, nerve pain + unspecified autoimmune disorder) anyone relate? ","So I got a tattoo today (we finished about 12 hours ago now) and I'm definitely in the beginning of a huge flare up. I have quite a few so it's not like this was my first one and now I'm having this reaction, but it was one of my biggest ones yet (about 5x3.5 inches I only have one bigger than this one). I'm having really bad nerve pain in the arm I got the tattoo on and in both legs and its a lot worse than my baseline, my HR was around 140 the entire time I was getting tattooed and it stayed there for a while but it's finally dropped to around 110 laying down. My artist was great! Shes a registered cna caregiver outside of being a tattoo artist and she works with people with pots often so she knew to check in a lot and was really fine with breaks when I needed them which definitely helped the few times my heart rate really got up there, but just getting the tattoo was triggering my pots and I'm finally starting to come down from that

But mostly what I'm worried about is the autoimmune reaction I'm having, I always have an autoimmune reaction to new piercings and tattoos, usually a low fever for a few days and a lot of swelling and itching (especially at the body mod site and the surrounding joints, but also all my healed tattoos swell up and itch) but this one is feeling particularly bad, my fever is higher than usual, the onset was faster, the swelling is worse (I can barely bend my arm and have a lot of swollen lymph nodes) I almost feel like I have the flu and I feel too fatigued to do pretty much anything, I'm worried that I'm especially allergic to the brand of ink that was used or something 

Way too much of being disabled feels like try to find the line between ""worthy of an ER visit"" and ""it'll probably go away on its own"" 😭 

Anyways not really asking for advice (but I wouldn't say no to some if anyone has it) but mostly I just wanted to see if anyone else has bad reactions or flares when they get body mods?

Job Interview Advice,"So, for reference walking into this post. I'm 22M, recent college grad, have an invisible disability (however invisible you consider high-functioning autism to be), and have recently begun looking for work.

For me, I decided to start leaning towards retail stores for my choice of where to begin my job hunt. This is largely because my disability is paired with a peanut allergy, so I can't really do places that force me to interact with peanuts/peanut products. I've gotten a few interviews so far, but no dice. 

I've come to the conclusion that it may be an hours thing, as retail stores usually desire evening/weekend availability. However, part of the problem I have here is that my disability renders evenings/weekends unavailable as these times are how I keep my stress/mental health in check and ensure that I am living a healthy life. Because of the need for structure, switching things up constantly or working unorthodox hours is a no-go. 

So, I'm trying to come up with a proper way to address this on future job applications and interviews moving forward to hopefully bolster my odds, and I figured this was a good place to start for advice. My understanding of ADA is that if I am rejected for the sole reason of my disability (ie, my disability renders evenings/weekends unavailable but they desire me to work those hours), that would be disability discrimination, which of course, is illegal. Lying about my availability is sketchy, taboo, and possibly even illegal. Mentioning a disability in an interview can sometimes open up discrimination that way, which is bad. How would I go about my disability in a way that ensures I can't be rejected based on the accommodation I would need, without striding any moral or legal lines?",4,1ek3r23,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ek3r23/job_interview_advice/,6,1722800058.0
Shower and hair care as a disabled person ,"So I have a bunch of health issues. But the ones that matter for this are: pots, eds, psoriatic arthritis, iih, and dysonomania

Should I just give up on disability until I'm older? ,"So I (20f) have Autism and Adhd, citrullinemia type II (which is a rare protein condition, and may affect me more now that I'm an adult but I don't know how much it will effect me) And possibly something else,, I have two doctor appointments, one to go over blood work to see if I have arthritis for the pain I have, and the other for my condition so they can do more research on it. I have already applied for disability I believe in April/may? and we are waiting for the results but I'm sure I'll get denied since it's my first time. 

the thing is i honestly don't know if I should apply again after it. But i don't know if I can really keep a job and not end up wanting to quit in 4 months. The last two jobs I have had around month 4 I would cry before going in because of the constant 9/10 pain, and how horrible I felt. I kept saying to myself that it was normal to feel like this. I also was stubborn and still went to work at my last job because I didn't want to quit but I had to resign because I was throwing up for a month straight almost and missed a lot of work. Turned out to be a uti, even though they didn't detect it in the first two hospital visits, but I got medicine for it and it seemed to help. Being off of work has helped as well with pain. 

I kept silent about the pain until now since this last month I have had terrible back and feet pain and broke down. I still feel like my pain isn't valid at all even when I'm in pain, or not in pain. I haven't worked in a year but doing things around the house can even exhausted me fast especially if its hot.

I have told my family about my autisim and adhd but it's been dismissed (maybe I didnt explain it correctly, but I still get dismissed for voicing things that effect me) and they think I can still do everything and my issue is that I'm just lazy. and just because they can work I can(even my cousin with adhd say I'm just lazy and it hurt me a little ngl) . My grandma has already voiced since I'm 20 I can't possibly understand pain or having trouble getting up when waking up, but I do.

My friends mom doesn't know everything since I only talked for a couple minutes about it but she said that disability won't care because I'm young and have some pain. which I completely have already thought about but having other people say it just makes me more hopeless about it.

my mom and therapist are the only ones that truly has shown support and think I need at least to get medical diagnosis. It's helped that they support me but I haven't been able to 100℅ accept it myself. especially with feeling like an imposter. I feel like now I'm just a big baby and nothing (including audhd) is real anymore and I'm actually just lazy. I'm just stuck.

Doing YouTube as a wheelchair user,"
Hi everyone👋 My names Bell, I’m 23 and a full time wheelchair user from the UK!🇬🇧 

I’ve recently started a YouTube channel called Blue_Bellife in the hopes of making new friends that I can connect with as loneliness and low self esteem is something that I’ve struggled with. Never in a million years did I think I’d be doing something like this and every time I post a video I have to fight so hard not to delete it but so far it’s been okay🙂I’m a bit of a homebody and I enjoy making videos about things that bring me joy whether that’s taking my dogs for a walk, stuffing my face with my favourite food😅or working on some of my hobbies. My goal is to make honest, realistic videos about the highs and lows of everyday life as a wheelchair user to hopefully share a little happiness to others, make some new online friends and help people feel less alone despite what you’re going through in life!

Is there any other disabled YouTubers here? Has your experience been positive? I’m scared about hate comments, I haven’t received any yet but I’m sure it will come eventually😕

I’ve included a few pictures of me and my two Pomeranians 🐻‍❄️Buddy & Bee🐻who keep me going even when I don’t think I can.

Social Security is the Worst,"Long story short, after my reevaluation I lost my SSI benefits. The reason, I kept student loan refund, and they see it as income, even though it’s not my money.

I dropped the part-time enrollment because there’s only one more course for my degree, I was aware of this a year ago, so I kept it.

They looked in my bank account, saw it, and I explained that it wasn’t income, it was a loan. I explained that I kept it anticipating tuition, books, and supplies would run me about $2500-$3000. 

I have since paid tuition, and have the books and supplies budgeted for, I’m well under $2000, the rest of the money went back to the loan, and now I have just $267.

The asset limit is a load of garbage, it needs increased. Considering it was not income, it’s even more irritating. It feels like we are punished for trying to better ourselves.

Would getting this checked out be worth it? ,"Due to lifelong symptoms and both confirmed and remembered events it’s suspected I had a brain injury or serious head injury that went undiagnosed and untreated when I was between the ages of 0 and 9. Possibly made worse by one or more of my untreated concussions throughout my childhood. No one ever believed me about my memory problems, emotional regulation problems or any of my other symptoms so I never got proper help… now as an adult with a few professionals who actually listen to me the bigger picture is coming together. But it’s way too late for any treatment so I’m not sure if the effort is worth it. 

Quick background: born via vacuum after they lost my heart rate. I was so tiny i couldn’t breast feed.

My head has been hit hard many times throughout my childhood. Mostly accidents…

I’ve shown symptoms of autism from a very young age but as a teen I started noticing a level of self awareness that honestly, makes me feel like I’m trapped. Like my brain is inside a typical brain and I know it’s there but I can’t access it.

Also my memory is very unpredictable and unorganized. Like a filing cabinet that keeps getting thrashed, reorganized, burned and recycled. 

My brain has always struggled with positive emotions and memories. My baseline seems to be depression and I don’t know why. That didn’t show up until late elementary school as far as I’m aware. Sadly it’s hard for me to know my own emotions. Especially positive ones. I’ve learned how to recognize negative emotions well because it’s what I have most of the time. 

I have auditory hallucinations that are mostly sounds and gibberish voices. Under stress they get worse and eventually if stressed enough I have visual hallucinations. 

I have a hard time describing how I feel and what I’m experiencing making help far from possible most of the time. What I’m describing doesn’t even come close to the full extent of this… 

I’ve had psychosis before and sometimes I still have vivid hallucination states where I’m in a strange place or someone else. Usually I snap out of it slowly and they don’t last more than a few minutes. It takes me a moment to collect myself because of the confusion from coming back to reality. There’s one I have repeatedly. 

Sometimes I feel like I’m somebody else within myself. Sometimes that makes me worry that the imaginary voice I created as a kid is a part of him… that voice developed into its own entity as I got older. 

These symptoms and more really screw with my head and stress me out. I feel like I need to claw open my skull and rip my brain out! It’s overwhelming, frustrating, scary and another emotion I can’t explain. Usually it’s just normal to me but when I start realizing it’s a prison cell again it’s really gets to me ",1,1ek1ofn,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ek1ofn/would_getting_this_checked_out_be_worth_it/,1,1722794912.0
Device/way to alert partner who doesn't hear me calling her name?,"My partner just straight up does not hear me call her name and we recently moved to a place that has even thicker walls than our last apartment. She frequently leaves her phone in the room where I am during the times I most need her help. There have also been times where she's had her phone and just straight up has not felt/noticed me calling her on it. I don't want to use a little bell because that feels rude and demeaning.

Is there some sort of wearable device that exists where I could ping her on it if she's in another room that won't also call 911? Cause that's what the fall devices do and I don't need that. This is for when I'm symptomatic and cannot sit up and either cannot or do not want to scream at the top of my lungs in order to get her help.

I know the ""Bond touch bracelets"" are an option and would allow me to use my apple watch to buzz her, but I really would prefer to have something that has a distinct noise or ringtone. She's a composer, so I know she'd be likely to notice a specific chime.

Invisible disability ableism strikes again,"So for context, I have Lupus and I work at a movie theater scanning tickets so I sit on a chair instead of standing all shift (like 5-8 hours usually).

I'm scanning tickets like usual when this guy comes up to get his scanned. He asks how I'm doing and I cheerfully respond with my usual ""Could be better. How about you?""

He immediately got aggravated with me and said ""Could be better? You're getting paid to sit on your ass!""

I calmly replied that I have Lupus so I can't stand for the whole shift and then he changed his tune and became calm. But like oh my god. Chair or not, I'm getting paid to do my job.

Disability has only allowed me to work sporadically ,"Hey all! I am a 37 years old female with cauda equina syndrome (diagnosed 3 separate times within a year!) I've hired a lawyer to help me with obtaining disability as I am truly unable to work. I am paralyzed in my lower right leg and my bladder. They have agreed to take my case, even knowing I have very little work history over the last 10 years. I was originally injured in 2005 in a car accident that has caused so many issues over the years that it's been really hard to hold down a job. I would miss so many days because I was unable to get out of bed for days due to pain and spasms. Because of this my job history looks terrible. I'm worried they are going to claim that if I never really held down a job in the decade, why would I need disability. The answer to that has a lot to do with inflation honestly. It has become increasingly difficult to live with a 1 income household. And I've tried to work, I really have. But for the last 2 years I havent even been  able to babysit or clean on the side like I could before when things were especially hard financially. And now things are much worse. My initial injury set into motion everything that led to the explosion of surgeries in the last 2 years, including 9 surgeries. I do have a glimmer of hope since the lawyer took my case. But it doesn't mean I will be approved. I'm here looking for advice. What kind of paperwork will help my case? I don't want to overload them, but I dont want to leave anything important out either. And please don't suggest any type of fraud! I am not here looking for anything like that at all! I don't need to lie, I have enough trouble as it is just getting to the bathroom to worry about committing perjury. I can provide whatever other kind of information you need that might help give a better answer. 

The 5 year rule has MANY exceptions. Catastrophic conditions are under one of those conditions, and spinal cord injuries are one of them. The issue started many years ago and I've applied for disability before and was denied because I didn't know that lawyers were free unless you won. I had only just turned 18 when it started. That accident led to what I am dealing with now because my spine collapsed due to the initial injury. I'm not sure if I'm really explaining it well. But you can look up cauda equina syndrome, and exceptions to the 5 year rule. I'm not doing this because I want a hand out. I'm doing this because I have tried and failed to work for years because of this. And now there is no possibility of even working for a month here and there to make ends meet.

Newly disabled ,"On May 30th I (39 M) was run over by a semi trailer.  My brachial plexus was damaged. I don't fully know the extent, but as a result I've lost the ability to use my right arm. It will be 6 months to a year before I know if it'll heal.

I, however, believe in planning for the worst. So what I'm curious about is, what are some helpful tips for reconciling myself with the loss of use of my arm. I have worked manual jobs my entire life, I have no college education. I feel lost with my future if I never get my arm back. 

I was ambidextrous, I use my left hand to write and eat, but most other tasks were right side dominant.

I'm still healing so mobility is difficult now, but once I'm able to move better, what can I expect in terms of adjusting to life with a paralyzed arm?",34,1ej4zrz,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ej4zrz/newly_disabled/,15,1722696240.0
Doing YouTube as a wheelchair user,"
Hi everyone👋 My names Bell, I’m 23 and a full time wheelchair user from the UK!🇬🇧 

I’ve recently started a YouTube channel called Blue_Bellife in the hopes of making new friends that I can connect with as loneliness and low self esteem is something that I’ve struggled with. Never in a million years did I think I’d be doing something like this and every time I post a video I have to fight so hard not to delete it but so far it’s been okay🙂I’m a bit of a homebody and I enjoy making videos about things that bring me joy whether that’s taking my dogs for a walk, stuffing my face with my favourite food😅or working on some of my hobbies. My goal is to make honest, realistic videos about the highs and lows of everyday life as a wheelchair user to hopefully share a little happiness to others, make some new online friends and help people feel less alone despite what you’re going through in life!

Is there any other disabled YouTubers here? Has your experience been positive? I’m scared about hate comments, I haven’t received any yet but I’m sure it will come eventually😕

I’ve included a few pictures of me and my two Pomeranians 🐻‍❄️Buddy & Bee🐻who keep me going even when I don’t think I can.

Help dealing with work?,"A little about me: I’m autistic and have ADHD as well as a couple milder chronic physical issues that don’t have diagnoses yet. Long story short I was very severely affected by mental illness for a long time and I have fought tooth and nail as I grew up to be able to not be jobless, homeless, or dead by now. Over the years I have accrued a lot of work trauma from employers who simply do not like me/do not want to deal with me and have found bullshit reasons to fire me without offering any assistance or alternatives.

Now, my situation: I am on my second round of corrective action up to a final warning at my career level job that I’ve worked at for over 2 years now. I do not sit and refuse to do work and most issues that have been raised by any employer including this one have been directly disability-related (communication, interpersonal interaction, etc). I am well versed in what I need to succeed as I have had IEPs since elementary school and have had to fight to have those enforced too, and I have offered multiple suggestions during and before my recent performance improvement plan. Well, they were all ignored and I was looked at like I had three heads suggesting them, even though one suggestion (a moderated meeting with the coworkers taking issue with me, of whom there are not a ton) has already been implemented once with a previous coworker and was largely successful. They deemed the PIP a failure and gave me the final warning. This is not new behavior from management - this workplace has a history of just taking me in for a meeting with no agenda sent beforehand (also something I’ve repeatedly asked for) and telling me all the things I did wrong, with little productive discussion on solving these things. Every time I try to reiterate that I have asked for things I am not getting and that their communication to me is also lacking, they just tell me to take accountability, despite me stressing myself into physical health issues trying to meet their requests. I am not refusing to put effort in, and in fact I am trying every avenue I can to help myself. I have cried in these meetings because of the things said to me. I have been made to feel broken and terrified about anything I do there, and as an autistic person I do not work well under that constant anxiety, so this is also actively sabotaging my performance while I am already under corrective action for said performance.

I am in the process of disputing the final warning so that I can try and move to a different department under different management, but even then I would still need to actually get hired and hope they aren’t massively ableist there too, which is complicated by the fact that I already asked to try and transfer out of this environment while still on corrective action and was refused before the appeal decision on the final warning was even made. If they don’t annul the final warning based on my dispute, per policy I am stuck in this job for a year, with ableist management that could cost me my livelihood at any moment. 

There are only two other facilities in the area like the one I work at, and both are a 45+ minute commute and offer less benefits and a more customer-facing workload that I would struggle with. I am currently surviving and *sometimes* able to scrape together enough to be saving for a home in a high COL area because of the benefits I have that make my and my chronically ill partner’s healthcare nearly free, and because of the fact that I only have to fill up on gas around once a month due to my short commute. So I cannot get fired or leave this facility, or I would be poorer than I already am and potentially struggle even more with the new work. Moving back with my parents last time I did it in college almost killed me, so I am trying to avoid that as well.

I don’t know what to do. The decision on the final warning is coming on or before Wednesday, and if they uphold it and I do nothing then I’ll probably lose my job within the year. It feels like there is no getting through to these people that I need different help than a lot of others, or they’re just not interested in giving it. Hopefully now that I have spoken to my supervisor’s boss (most of the issues are with my supervisor and he’s a micromanager of course) something will get done, but she’s going to be the one making the decision so if she doesn’t overturn it I know she’s not in my corner either.",1,1ejpxok,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ejpxok/help_dealing_with_work/,2,1722757925.0

Whats a good speech-to-text service do you use?,"It's 2024, and there are mediocre quality at best dictation services.

I use Google Keep Notes, Gmail, and Docs. 



Yes, I am aware that there are services like [otter.ai](http://otter.ai) that use your meeting notes from the web to transcribe them. However, I'm looking for a more localized solution that can hopefully work across multiple apps.

Was I wrong for using the handicap stall?,"To be clear, I am NOT disabled. I used to work as a server at a restaurant and while getting drinks for on of my tables, I spilled boiling hot water all over myself. I ended up scaulding my stomach pretty badly, to the point where I had blisters. 

I retrieved some medical supplies from a first aid kit and went to the restroom to dress my burn. There was only one bathroom in the restaurant that was shared by the customers and staff. I went into the disability stall since the burn covered a farly large area on my body and I'd have more space to take my clothes off and work with the bandages and such. 

As I'm dressing the wound, an older lady with a walker comes into the bathroom and starts scolding me through the door, and telling me that I should pick a different stall to get changed. I told her I was almost finished, and she responded with something like ""I only have one stall to use, you could have chosen any other. I can't wait all day if every normal person needs to use my stall."" 

Rather than telling her my situation I just tried to finish and clean up the wrappers as quickly as possible. I figured I didn't want to start a potential argument since I was still in uniform representing the business. On my way out I apologized to her and went home for the day.

This happened a while ago and I recently came across a video talking about invisible reasons someone may need to use the handicap stall. I understand it must be frusterating having someone without a disability use the stall, and I do gernally try to avoid it. So since I am not disabled, it made me curious: was I in the wrong?

FSHD (Fascio Scapular Humeral Muscular Dystrophy) and sports ,"FSHD and sports

30m here with confirmed FSHD. Is there any of you, or anyone you know with the disease that participate in sports at a high level? I myself have been suffering since my early teens however was not diagnosed until I was 27. In the meantime, although I knew something was very wrong with me and progressing, I took up an extreme form of mountain biking (freeride and downhill). I got to a level where I was competing in the professional level categories and started riding alongside some of the best athletes the sport has globally, not that I was ever quite at their level but enough that I was on their heels. I’ve never divulged my disability but in the past couple of years it has progressed to the point where the disease is beating out my ability to push my limits and I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with the same kind of situation. I’m scared to go fully public with it but I’m considering reinventing my now defunct career as a non-able bodied athlete instead, although that overwhelmingly feels like cheating or that I won’t be taken seriously due to me riding at the level I have done without a visible disability. Or, even more of a long shot, does anyone know of a manager willing to work with disabled action sports athletes? I’m struggling to find anything along those lines myself.

How to stop non medical people stating I'm severely mentally incapacitated,"Hello

  
I have a physical genetic disorder, this causes me flare ups of mobility issues, ie I can be physically capable of anything and everything for months but will then have a flare up and be bedridden for months.

  
It means I don't qualify for disability assistance, though as I'm getting older, my active periods are getting less and my inactive periods increasing so that may change re disability support.

  
My question at the moment is:-

  
I am having to deal with a financial issue, I should have received benefits to cover a time off ill re council tax (this has gone to bailiffs and I am paying off a set amount) but every time I speak to the council and subsequently now the bailiff company, they keep referring to me as severely mentally incapacitated, and they keep requesting I send this documentation through to them for them to be able to assist me.

  
I am not mentally incapacitated, they are not medical people, I am banging my head off a brick wall trying to sort this out with them.

  
Instead of them applying unemployment to the council tax account, they have charged me the full amount. I should have had this covered by unemployment. it hasnt been. They are citing the mental incapacity not being evidenced.

  
I have no clue what to do with people who think I'm not competent, but are quite happy to over charge me.

I am not on a high income, though I keep getting over charged by grubby money grabbers in positions of authority who make this mental incapacity claim without evidence then all avenues of communication are shut down until I provide evidence!!!!

I have evidence of a physical issue, this physical issue is causing intense pain and I often struggle to be coherent, but because of a pain issue, not a mental issue.

  
How do I tell ignorant people they are wrong and need to provide the actual support that is available re unemployment not mental incapacity!

Advice on socializing as a disabled person?,"I'm about to graduate college and I have a few friends there, but I struggle keeping in touch with them. I find it easiest to socialize with people via proximity (working on a theatre production with them, seeing them around campus, etc.) but seeing people has become more and more difficult. 

My corn allergy makes it so none of the cafeteria food is safe- no meals with anyone, and the progression of my hip dysplasia makes walking anywhere on campus incredibly painful (it also doesn't help my campus was build on the side of mountains.)

This leads to me holing myself up in my dorm except for classes. I don't tend to walk where posters for on-campus events are advertised, so I never know about them, and if I did, I'd probably decide it's not worth the pain to go to them.

I have such a hard time keeping in touch with people I'm not super duper close to, even in an online capacity. I get anxious messaging people I'm super familiar with because I can't see their non-verbal cues.

If it's this hard to keep in touch with people at college where everyone is within a concentrated radius of one another, I can't imagine how hard it will be once I move back home to make new friends. All my friends from childhood were much closer with each other than they were with me, and all of them have moved away. I don't know how I would try to build/keep up a relationship with them anymore, they all have irl friends so they don't spend a ton of time online.

I also live in a fairly small town that most people move away from when they're in their mid-20s, but I can't drive or financially support myself enough to move away, plus I need support from my family with my disabilities. I'm hoping that making friends will be easier once I'm out of college, there's a dnd place in my town that's mostly just hosting space for existing games, but they have other events there too that I might try to go to if I can find the energy, and the community theatre is where I can see myself spending most of my time, so I could potentially meet people through there? 

Idk, I guess I just needed to vent, but any advice on how to socialize/keep up relationships without being able to physically go see people is appreciated.

Disability representation in crochet for mental illness etc,"I follow some artists that have found ways to incorporate representation for physical disabilities e.g stuffed animal with medical aids/bandages. I've only seen one person have represtation for all kinds, she makes cute animal characters (but there's not necessarily 'direct' links?). Then theres artists who design clothing with disabled people in mind etc. 

I really want to try to create some kind of representation with crochet... I have adhd and depression so if anything it'd be for mental illness stuff but ideally for anyone too. Thing is I don't draw so can't make characters per say(don't wanna copy existing artists either) . I also only make animals or decorative things , not clothing. I can also cross stitch. 

But I just genuinely have no idea what might make others feel represented, especially when it comes to mental health stuff. I guess the closest Ive gotten so far is using my university club to try and make events for other students a bit more accessible in terms of activity options, but I want my own art to have something as well. 

Is there anything that anyone here has wished to see incorporated into crochet?? (or fibre arts/handmade items in general) literally any ideas would be helpful as inspiration :))

Adverse side effects?,"I just started a new medication 3 days ago. Today, while at work, I had a new kind of episode. I started feeling nausea, but just ignored it because I feel that a lot. Then my chest started feeling weird. After a few minutes I started having trouble breathing and almost collapsed right there. While trying to catch my breath, a numbing tingling feeling spread throughout my body. My vertigo was triggered and it was a lot all at once. I thought it was heart palpitations at first, but I'm not quite sure. I went home, and the symptoms started lessening after the initial 45 min. It took 3 hours before most of it went away, leaving me with a headache and continued chest weirdness. It's been 11 hours since the episode and I never went to the hospital. I'm not gonna take that medication anymore, but I'm wondering if I should talk to a doctor about seeing a cardiologist? Or get a medical allergy check done?

Why are people needlessly cruel to those of us with invisible disabilities? ,"I don't have a visible physical disability such as missing limbs, but I still have disabilities. People use the anonymity of the internet to bully because it apparently gets them off on making others upset?

Adhd, bipolar, ptsd, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, autism and the countless other mental disabilities that exist. They ARE disabling! 

Those of us with these conditions suffer. If we show our symptoms, people call us crazy or we arent trying hard enough to overcome it/control it, or we just want attention or for people to feel sorry for us. 

If we don't show our symptoms then we don't actually have anything wrong with us and we just want attention and want pity....? See how that works...

""You're just a bunch of snowflakes, everyone has these problems, you're not trying to power through it, you're just crying about it, you just want people to feel sorry for you, you're making it up, you just want to label everything, these didnt even exist when i was growing up, etc etc.""

 These are the comments I see everywhere on social media... and yes it gets to me. Because it's everywhere...

And those of us who are chronic pain patients? Same thing. It's invisible, so we are making it up. "" If it was really hurting that bad, you'd be crying!""

And if I do cry? ""Suck it up, I had to go to work with 2 broke feet. It's not that bad, just take some tylenol.""

So if I'm not crying, it isn't real, if I am crying, I'm being a baby 🫠🫠🫠🫠

How to decide cane vs walker vs rollinator?,"I have no balance left so I use a cane. I can't stand for more than a few minutes.

I don't know why, but I just can't get onboard for the walker and wheelchair ideas. I don't know why I have such issues with them - they would definitely improve my life and enjoyment of the activities I was doing on those few times I leave the house.

trouble using my cane,"For my entire life I’ve struggled to walk long distances. I could always physically do it, but at a certain point I would start to feel “droopy” kind of like i’m melting. For the past few years I’ve been having (diagnosis in slow progress due to anxiety disorder) issues with heartrate and chest tightness, along with knee cracking and what I call “knee fullness” feeling. Need to clarify that I am NOT looking for an armchair diagnosis here, this is just how it is.

Sometime last year I bought a cane to use while walking around my daily life… except I only used it like twice!! I feel like once I start using it, that’s it, and I can’t go back if I ever start to feel more comfortable without it so I just haven’t touched it. I am already trans and am scared to be looked at negatively.

I worry that I don’t actually need it because I won’t be putting much weight onto it, it would serve as a sort of “mobile countertop” that’s with me all the time. I do not faint and am not at any risk of falling without it.

I’m looking for suggestions on a MagSafe mount that I can attach to my wheelchair to hold my phone. I think it would be super useful to have an arm or platform attached to my wheelchair that securely holds a MagSafe charger or mount.

As a blind wheelchair user, I’m hoping someone can recommend a solution or share advice.

I don’t have a big budget, but I think I’d get a lot of use out of it, so any affordable options would be greatly appreciated.

Why Does No One Get It?,"I posted a little while ago about having issues with my landlord about parking. I have a long-term accessible parking placard, and the surface lot of my apartment only has two accessible spots -- but two other tenants with accessible placards, so insufficient accessible parking spots. When I asked about designating an additional parking spot, they turned me down. Ultimately, I chose to ""upgrade"" my parking to the garage because an accessible spot was opening up, and the reasonable accommodation they provided was allowing me to skip the line. I'm now paying $175/mo for parking versus $75 for the surface lot. 

Nearly three weeks ago, a major storm came through and messed up the control panel in my building. No one has been able to access the parking garage since then. They told all of the tenants in the parking garage to park at the church across the street (I'd have to cross a busy freeway exit and climb stairs to get in the building). They \*are\* allowing me to utilize the accessible spots in the surface lot (if they're available). It was supposed to be fixed yesterday, but it is still not working, and there's no clarity on when that will be. To make matters worse, my landlord has said, ""hey, we can't refund you because this was an act of nature and we acted promptly to fix the problem."" I have emailed them directly and explained how this has limited my access (I've mostly been working from home and avoiding going out to not deal with parking). They sent me the same response -- no refund.

This whole situation has caused me tremendous anxiety. I cried on my way home yesterday out of frustration because I genuinely thought it would be fixed. And when I've told family members about how upset I am, their responses are...underwhelming. I texted my mom to give her an update yesterday, and her response was \*literally\* ""that sux."" And then she immediately started texting me in great detail about a pan she got at a garage sale. It's like she didn't even care.

Suggestions for Newly Paralyzed—Please Help!!,"Hello everyone! My previously very active father was recently in a terrible accident leaving him paralyzed. I understand it is very early on in his treatment journey and it is unclear what his permanent disabilities will be at this point. While he continues therapy to hopefully regain some motor skills, I want to find things for him to do that make him feel a sense of independence and normalcy (his pre-accident “normal”) again. He can move his arms up/down, in/out and has some wrist movement, but he currently cannot move his fingers. He is unable to walk or move his legs much beyond some light quad flexing. 

I don’t have anyone in my life with physical disabilities so I’m hoping you all have some suggestions for me for handicap-friendly activities or hacks. I thought about things like a stand/bed clamp for his Kindle and a page turner button so he can read again, but he doesn’t have the dexterity to press the small remote button. We have him set up with audiobooks, but I know it would mean a lot to him if he could read. This is just one example! I’m completely open to other ideas! I just want to surprise him with something that brings him some joy and may help him cope with his new disability. Any suggestions are welcome and we will take all the help, tips, tricks, and ideas we can get! :) 

Edit — He is currently in intensive inpatient rehabilitation (for the next 4-6 weeks). Right now, he is bedridden. He can speak clearly and does not have any cognitive impairment. In that regard, he is exactly as he was pre-accident. Both sides of his body have about the same functionality at this point. Hope this info helps!

My work is discriminating against me because of my mental illnesses,"Long story short I work in sales and I have FMLA time to use as well as reasonable accomodations so for about half a year that allowed me to work 32 hours instead of 40. They said to me that if I kept my sales numbers up I could keep my accomodations and they would reevaluate my accomodations each quarter (which is odd because y'know I just don't STOP being disabled and it's a call center type job so it's a luck of the draw for calls) which I didn't care about at the time because I was a really good seller and calls were good because it was the holidays and people wanted to buy stuff. However during this past month I noticed that they stopped giving me the time of day as the quarter started approaching. They readjusted the type of calls we were getting so that we got more of them and so that the calls were more generalized meaning that I got worse calls and more calls that weren't actually sales calls which in turn hurt my sales numbers. I still pitched the stuff I needed to but my numbers weren't the same and despite me asking for help from my manager I stopped receiving it so I asked for help from my coworkers and friends. 

I was desperately still trying because I cared about keeping my 32 hours a week because it was good for my mental state. Eventually I had so many mental breakdowns that I took a leave of absence for two weeks. Even with the leave I took I was still meeting sales goals this month so it was a shock to me to come back and have a meeting with my manager and another manager where they told me that they wouldn't be granting them to me again because they have ""increased sales need with the holidays coming up"" and that I ""wasn't meeting sales goals for the quarter."" I also found this odd as I have texts between my manager and I from June with him reassuring me that I did great in May and was doing good in June! This statement also meant they weren't accommodating me AT ALL! After dropping this on me knowing I had a vacation planned this month based around my 32 hour schedule my manager told me that if I didn't have PTO to cover the days that are now added into my schedule (ie 5 day work weeks instead of 4) that he wouldn't approve my PTO time he had to manually add in - which is against our companies PTO policy btw. This of course is not recorded because it's on a work computer and I have no recording software downloaded and wouldn't be able to if I tried and they claimed they were going to write this down in our feedback application but I looked today and it's not there!!

Ambulatory Wheelchair User Looking For Advice (with background info),"Hi, so just a heads up, I'm writing on mobile and English is, unfortunately, my native language. Any mistakes are either my own or from the help of autocorrect.

To start, you can call me Blues. I'm 26, my pronouns are they/them, and I've been disabled since I was a baby. Got a lot of issues, but a few of the main ones I've been gifted (/sarcasm) are dysautonomia, orthostatic hypotension, and wonky legs (and that's not even counting my mental health). 

Gotta say, while I enjoy none of my issues, the wonky legs are the biggest thing I struggle to cope with; I can deal with the orthostatic hypotension via sitting in intervals with my legs propped up, but I can't exactly make my home wheelchair friendly for the days I can't even walk without crying or needing my husband to help me. Yeah, I have a cane and a walker/rollator, but... my cane isn't helping as much anymore.

Thus, my husband has pointed out that I may need to try using forearm crutches instead of my cane. The issue I have is summed up pretty easily: Despite the fact I was supposed to get them as a kid, I have no idea how to use them if I got them! Especially with stairs.

So, my biggest questions are narrowed down to these: Would you recommend trying them in place of my cane? If so, how do you use them? ",0,1eihpf9,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eihpf9/ambulatory_wheelchair_user_looking_for_advice/,0,1722623993.0
I feel myself getting more and more tired,"I recently changed doctors for the third or fourth time in the last year. I have moderate to severe back pains and I am finding it harder to walk or do my regular exercise. 

Before this doctor, the suggestions have just been to lose weight. I'm 5'1 and weigh around 190lbs so I don't think it's a ridiculous idea to lose weight, however I've dropped down to 180 in the past and just felt more lethargic and with more pain. I also find it incredibly difficult to lose weight without starving myself and torturing my body with exercise.

My last doctor wanted to put me on metformin to ""lose some weight"" before putting me on weight loss pills. I declined and switched to my current doctor. 

My current doctor sent me for lab work and some xrays and informed me that if the xrays were normal, she would order an mri. I was feeling hopeful since no doctor before even considered an mri.

This morning, she informed me that she is prescribing metformin, a cholesterol medication, with a possibility to go on ozempic later...

At this point, I give up. I'll take whatever fuckass medications they want to pump into me. I may never be able to walk, dance, or run the way I used to ever again.... but at least I'll be a ""reasonable weight"". I give up. If this is some sort of rare disease that is slowly killing me, that's fine. I didn't plan to live this long anyways, I wanted to die at 18. Now I'm struggling to stay afloat at 24 and I can't function like the human being I want to be so why try anymore.

I can't do it anymore. When I get off work, I can't sit down because my back is so tightened up from forcing myself to stand upright and the rest of me is on the brink of collapse. I don't leave my home except work because it's so bad. Was trying to give an idea of where I'm at, sorry if it sounds too harsh.

Basically, how do I need to go about this? I hear that oh, you're gonna get rejected because you're working, so you must be fine, type stuff. Well, I'd rather go through this daily trauma than quit and be without money, homeless, no where to sleep, etc, way worse if you know what I mean. For context, I support myself, so if I stopped working, the money stops coming type deal. 

Any advice or anything would be greatly appreciated, I have no idea what I'm doing here, and I'm alone on this tough journey. Thanks everyone 


Edit, I meant to state this originally, I see everyone talking about it now. I don't work at that job anymore, and as it's been 2 yrs, is filing for workers comp a realistic option now? Also, the place I work at now is owned by the same company that owns the business I hurt myself at 2 yrs ago. How is this going to go down?
I originally wanted to get workers comp, but I was living with family at the time, it was a bad situation and the bottom line, they wouldn't let me go that route, and I needed to save money and move away from them.

The loneliness of being disabled in a very ableist country is crushing. TW parental death.,"That's about it, sorry for posting this here but I just don't have anyone I can talk to. 

Yesterday was the anniversary of my mother's death. She died young and tragically (as did others in my life) and I don't have any heirlooms or any of her art, or even photos of her. Her relatives took everything and I was young and poor and couldn't sue as I had no support. But that's another issue entirely. So it makes her death and birthdays even harder as I don't have any pieces of her, so to speak. They didn't even give me her ashes and they didn't even give her a headstone (her relatives were wealthy, she was the artsy bohemian black sheep). 

So anyways all I wanted the last couple days, as cliche as it is (go ahead and laugh) was someone to hold me and comfort me. But I have nobody.

I'm currently trying to severely restrict caloric intake so I can lose weight, hoping (much as I hate that word) that gives me a bit more chance out in this world. Not that I can get out into it here without a car, or a close friend who has one to take me places, as it's just too inaccessible for me any other way in this city. I don't know if being thin again (or at least voluptuous but not extremely fat) and will make these jerks here give me a chance, but, they aren't worth my time anyway. I'm trying to focus on writing and looking better (if only I had the funds for cosmetic surgery, lipo, etc) so I can leave here and find some place I'm appreciated again, as I was before disability and moving to the UK. I have so much to offer but nobody can look past my weight, my wonky face, and my very visible disability.

To others out there without family, with no local friends, who aren't ever considered as romantic partners - I'm sorry you have to endure this too. It's sickening how people, society, and government treat us, and then we're weak or pathetic or not strong and independent enough if we ever talk about it or let it affect us, which ofc it does. 

I've been thru 20 times what those who judge me have, I should be applauded just for still being here and having my wits about me. 

I am not eloquent at all right now (brain injury) and I'm sure there's typos and but I just don't have it in me to edit or condense.  ",132,1ehfj6n,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ehfj6n/the_loneliness_of_being_disabled_in_a_very/,17,1722515629.0

Slippery Cane Handle Solution,If you have issues with your cane handle being slippery I highly recommend going to a farm store and buying horse leg tape. It is essentially the same as the self-sticking ace bandage wrap for a fraction of the cost with a large selection of colors. It took around a minute to get a good tight wrap and only cost me $2.99 + tax for a 5 yard roll. It makes the handle extremely grippy and is a must have with the hot weather in my area.,15,1ehs0rw,disability,https://i.redd.it/o6wmyai2c4gd1.jpeg,2,1722546817.0
What is your internal dialogue like when others (coworkers or family) express disbelief in your disability?,"I'm struggling at my workplace.  Ive told people about my sciatica, my ADD, my struggles with anxiety/depression, and eveb my ethnic background and somehow they find a way to say im lying for some reason. I get that some on our team have abused these time off using fake illnesses, but i dont think im deserving of this. 

At one point, when i was at my worst, i spent a week speaking to my mother about the country we are from just so I could stop questioning  reality, but thats just an example. Recently, its been around my limp and sciatica. 

I speak to and have spoken to multipls therapists and counselors (multiple) about not being belived at work, and about my sense of self. My current therapist thinks it would be a good idea to sort of crowdsource points of view to see how others may deal with this internally, and so: 

What is your internal monologue like when facing this kind of adversity? I know the answer is to just not care. But i dont know how. I do feel confident about myself, but somtimes it just gets to me. Maybe hearing what thoughts and emotions you experience as the denial occurs(whether overt or in passing) would help me understand what its like to not care .",19,1ehpiln,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ehpiln/what_is_your_internal_dialogue_like_when_others/,17,1722540680.0

allergies.,"i recently learned i have an allergy to latex/latex adhesive and latex fruit syndrome, and even more recently learned i've become allergic to all peppers (fruit). now, i have to check every ingredients list for them and i'm slowly becoming more n more frustrated at how limited my options are getting. even more-so at how only nut and dairy allergens are highlighted so i have to painstakingly read the entire list, which can get long since i'm American (iykyk), while cross-checking my can't-have list.

ik it sounds like i'm complaining to complain, but i had no idea latex fruit syndrome even existed until i learned the very hard way. my 1st reaction was when i tried avocado toast, took ONE bite and said ""ew, no"", and then had full-body hives and angioedema for three weeks straight. all the while, i had no idea what i was having was a SEVERE allergic reaction because a) no one told me you could be allergic to literally anything/everything and b) it could related to other allergies you have, espec ones that run in the family like mine do. if labels included latex fruit warnings, i probably would've known avocados and pumpkins weren't a random thing i just ~mysteriously~ couldn't have way sooner.

but i digress. this rant started bc i found out my favorite pickle brand uses red bell pepper in their brine and now i have half a jar of pickles i have to just throw away bc i'm the only pickle lover in my family. at least i'm not allergic to cucumber and/or dill like i thought i might've been bc i had eaten sm more pepper than i thought i had last reaction. i've been in/out of the hospital since Tues last week and Thurs (pickle-pepper aftermath) was the worst visit by far.",2,1ehwyrn,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ehwyrn/allergies/,6,1722560023.0

WTF ,"I (42F, disabled) went to the pharmacy for an OTC item today. I arrived and parked legally in the last handicap space.

She gets out with her cane - still glaring at me the entire time I proceed to get my rollator walker from my truck and she walks toward the door. She was walking fast enough to be in front of me from a parking space further away. We happened to need items from the same aisle. I had not said anything to her and didn’t return her rude glares. She positioned herself just behind my right shoulder, waited till I lifted my right hand from my walker and took her hand and lifted up and shook my fucking walker nearly making me fall. She says she wanted to know if it was lightweight bc it looked lightweight and she has one at home but it’s too heavy for her. WTF lady, I’m not over here grabbing your cane asking if it’s light weight. Don’t be a fucking ageist. Disability doesn’t discriminate by age you crazy broad!

Trying to decide my working life,"So I currently work part-time doing direct care in a group home. Have been with the same company for over 6 years. It's a pretty easy job. It doesn't cause much stress and is mostly sedentary. Physically it takes a little out of me but I usually recover by the end of the night. I'm also on SSDI

I'm starting to burn out. Between autism, chronic pain, chronic fatigue, shizoaffective disorder, and a variety of annoying things. My pain and fatigue are the worst.

 I really loved my job. The healthcare system is broken but I was able to make a difference in people's lives and make things better. But for the last 3 months I've been slowly burning out and I'm near the end of my rope, physically and mentally. I don't want to lose my client. we've been working together 3 years. If I leave or take a sabbatical he'll go to someone else and he has a lot of trouble coping with change. Also his family considers me a member of the family. It's a great situation but I'm struggling.

The thing I was thinking about going into reselling. I did it before and I was good at it. It's basically buying items low and selling high. Except for getting the stuff it's all online. The physical part has me concerned. There's packaging, taking pics, organizing, etc. the paperwork for the SSA and the state are convoluted and Kafkaesque. There will be a lot of driving and that makes me tired. Don't get me wrong, I've done it before and can do it again. It will aggravate my pain but not to the point of exhaustion. I can pace myself and take breaks though.

I have to keep working cause bills.

Someone purposely put a large garbage bin in my path.,"I walk at night/early morning with my rollator very often. It's short distances with LONG brakes. 
As I (22 F) was walking down hill (which I find difficult) a guy putting his bins in his entrance (its trash day that same morning) spots me slowly walking down the hill.
Maybe 8 meters away the guy pushes one of many very large and over filled bin right on the sidewalk. As he pushes it he's looking at me. 

Since it was 2 am I don't react at all but I'm hoping he'll get it, so I don't have to get off the sidewalk...
I was so wrong he instead looks at me the whole freaking time as I double check I won't get hit by a car as I drop off the side walk to walk around his disgusting large bin. 

Then after I hop back on the sidewalk not even a minute later he moves it back into his driveway.

Weight gain,"Honestly I could cry. Also hi new here. I have become physically disabled after a pregnancy related injury and it’s just getting worse. Before pregnancy I was essentially a gym rat. 3-5 days a week, HITS, weights you name it. I have PCOS so weight has always been an issue since puberty, but I eat ok and my food intake has never had a huge effect on loss or gain of weight, but level of activity has and medication/ hormone fluctuations. Since becoming less able to move up till now where I pretty much can’t walk without agony, I’ve put on so much weight, which in turn is not helping my back hips. I’ve tried restricted diets, done physiotherapy. Keep piling on the weight and get told to eat less. I’m also Autistic, so I eat quite a bland diet anyway, and done have a big appetite (like 2 slices of toast is more than enough to keep me going for a while and I’m not a big snack eater) I just don’t know what to do. My docs won’t even see me despite putting in appointment requests. They just send me a new pain med prescription and re-referral me to the same people who keep tell me to essentially starve myself and do not believe my food diary is accurate.

Being young and disabled is hard!,"I am a 26 year old androgynous human, that has peripheral neuropathy, degenerate hips and lower spine, as well as scoliosis and PTSD. A lot of people don't see my bad days because, like most of us I'm sure, I don't go out really on bad days. 
I have a disability placard and mobility aids; Walker and wheelchair we got from goodwill. 
I feel like I can't go out in public without being either judged or harassed because I don't look like a cripple enough?😭 Like no offense to anyone except ableists but we can't all look like people that had to have their limbs amputated?? 
I've been harassed for using a mobility aid in public, they acted like the wheelchair was theirs because he was older than me. 
Even parking, because apparently the DMV didn't give me the actual wheelchair user placard? I didn't know there was a different one for that, but I was told by someone that I didn't have the right one and that someone could tow our car if I parked in Van accessable without the right pass and it's just so anxiety inducing because just the process alone of getting one is a hassle, let alone going back more than once to get ""the right one"" 😭 I even filled out the paperwork for the wheelchair user one so I assumed I was good??
Everyone just assumes that because they see me walking that I'm just faking it but I'm in so much pain constantly that not even pain meds, muscle relaxers, and cannabis can really help. 
Growing up was hard too, because I was in a conservative family who said I was lazy, and thought that by having surgery at 9 I was magically cured for life because God wanted it🥲

I don't even want to go out anymore because I feel like I'm just a target for people. I used to have 3 jobs, go on 10 mile hikes, walk across town, etc but now 5 years later I can barely stand long enough to do my own dishes. It's just very frustrating and scary. I really am struggling with feeling like a burden even though I know I'm not. 

Does anyone else feel like this? These are supposed to be the years that people my age go do crazy things, but my crazy things are just existing without feeling guilty doing regular people stuff. Like, I want a service animal but I also can't take care of like a dog or something like that ya know? It's just really hard and I feel kinda lost so I'm hoping to find some community on Reddit 🥲💖 I already talked to both my therapists about it.

Advice needed for disabled adventurer taking their first time long-haul flight,"Hello! My parents are looking to come to Australia this December for about a month but they are quite anxious about the journey. My mother struggles moving around, she has a disability card but is not at the stage where she would need a wheelchair. Their budget unfortunately cannot stretch to First class tickets, so we are very much looking at standard economy. 

So I am calling out to the Reddit community to ask for any tips or advice you would have to help us plan. I am ideally looking for any advice on which airline to take or avoid, if it's ok to book economy tickets and simply ask for assistance (will that give them better seats?), minimum time for a connection, etc.

Help me survive the winter,"I am undiagnosed but I have a very hard time surviving the winter.  It's a little better now that I can drive and don't have to be out in the elements as long, but it's still an issue for me.  On top of this, my school built half of the classroom walls overnight and never fixed the HVAC so every hour it's a whole new climate.  I also walk with a cane and the lockers are broken so even if I got one it's a coin flip on whether I can open it or not.  Basically my school is falling apart more than my joints.

So now I need to figure out a way to survive the cold outdoors and sometimes cold indoors, while also being able to survive a heat wave at a moment's notice, and be able to carry everything I need for school and to wear.  I also need to eat ?  The school food is actual poison and it's a closed campus so I have to survive off of food I bring in and snacks.  And I have to carry all this.  

I cannot be missing as much school as I have in this past the winter always gets me

My condition ,"I never spoke out about this but I just want to talk about my condition because why not:)

 I always wanted to do so many things like to play tennis, wear a certain outfit, play piano, acting, dancing, and so much more but unfortunately I was born with one arm and also unfortunately I was bullied alot in elementary so basically all my life I've been hiding under a jacket or sweater to feel comfort and to lower the stares and looks I get in public places. Since my mom passed I kinda regret not keeping my promise to stop being ashamed and do what I want, which I tried but unfortunately I can't.
I don't think I'll get out of it soon since I'm too paranoid and ""shy"" I guess. 
I'm in high school and it's been a crazy ride, I've only had a few people ask me about it and ofc I tell them about it but I noticed how people are treating me. 
I'm not sure why ppl talk to me like I'm a lost puppy on the street but it's kinda frustrating because i see it clear as day they don't see me as an equal and unfortunately I'm used to that, I think most people look down on me and feel sorry for me which is fine but it's not like I have no arms haha.
I always wished I had two arms because I would be more confident and so outgoing like my mom when she was in school, but I can't, not like this.
My family always told me it was a ""blessing"" and yeah maybe but it's more of a curse to me. Like if I were to go up to someone to just talk to them or if my dad and I are getting tickets to see a movie people's eyes quickly spot my arm though it's hidden underneath the jacket, yes ofc ppl can tell but not always first glance so it's understandable if they keep looking. I was uncomfortable with this when I was younger, but now I see it's more because of curiosity and not like ""eww wtf"". 
Anyways, I'm making progress a little, I'm still hiding but I'm more open to sharing my hobbies and doing what makes me happy such as reading, writing books, doing yoga, painting, and dancing a little. I'm accepting and loving myself slowly, it's gonna be a while but I hope to one day be a better person. I'm an only child so I tend to figure out things myself like I've always done, so I'm sure I can do this, it's not like I need an ""extra hand"" you know hahaha.

Veteran denied access: Service Dog,"This post is going around my city/area's Facebook groups. What happened at this business is appalling and their response to the veteran + his family is even worse. They are responding to Google reviews about this by digging their heels in and claiming that the service dog would ""fundamentally alter the nature"" of their business because it would probably rip up their 300k flooring with its nails.

This guy wasn't trying to bring the dog into bounce houses, just watch his kids play from the floor! And to top it off, this man is a combat veteran, purple heart. If you're able to share this widely, please do.

Love/hate relationship with grocery delivery services,"I love the fact that we can order grocery delivery and etc. now, I do. I physically can't shop in the store anymore and I couldn't survive without delivery services. However, I've had so many mistakes with my deliveries. I get they happen, but I've had the following:

1. Shorted about $60-70 worth of frozen groceries. I had to physically go to the grocery store to sort it out, even though doing so crashed me and I could barely stand while I was waiting customer service to figure out what happened to my missing groceries.
2. Had a shopper buy me a three carton box of regular milk from Costco, when I clearly asked for lactose-free milk and marked no substitutions. I ended up with milk I couldn't drink and physically was incapable of returning it to the store. I did get a refund and had to give the milk away, but still didn't actually have milk that I could drink. I can only guess that the guy who shopped for me was completely clueless and had no idea there was a difference between lactose free and regular milk.
3. Refrigerated items a month past the expiration date.
4. Missing or wrong items.
5. Expired or close to expiring fresh vegetables or fresh vegetables/fruit that were close to rotten.
6. Had someone deliver both my groceries AND someone else's groceries to me. I was puzzled why I had so many bags and fortunately realized that they gave me things that I hadn't ordered before they left. I made my shoppers/delivery people stay while I had to sort through every bag and then give them back multiple bags that weren't mine. I then had to check and make sure that I wasn't charged for all of those items that weren't mine.

Like, is it too much to expect people to do the bare minimum to check for expiration dates, that items are correct, or edible in the case of fresh vegetables? I have so little spoons as it is and it's frustrating to keep having to deal with major delivery mistakes.

I just get so frustrated by my inability to go shopping myself, so that I'm not wasting my time or money on food that is bad/wrong/missing.",11,1eh3nig,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eh3nig/lovehate_relationship_with_grocery_delivery/,6,1722473729.0

What to do when HR denies accommodation and then refuses to tell you why in writing?,"I’m partially nonverbal auDHD, have auditory processing disorder and requested to use an AAC (a device that I can type into to speak on my behalf, like Stephen Hawking; it would also transcribe things that people say to me).

I want disabled people to be able to have physical community too. ,"This is a gentle rant. 

Tonight I was looking looking for an art class in my community. (My family has complained forever about the fact that I never leave the house. They don't understand the idea that there is nowhere for me to go) And I think about the fact that I would like to live a fuller life so I need to find activities to do. So I went to my local event website and I found one and it was even free, which is great for me, only to find out that it's in a really old building that has stairs and no accessible entrance. 

And this is what I mean by there is no place for me to go when my family asked why I don't leave the house. We have cultivated a society that sometimes gently, other times harshly pushes disabled people to the margins but calls it access because it exists. There is nothing that makes me wish I was ablebodied more than the fact the world is automatically open to ablebodied people. 

And the worst part is no matter how I explain this to my family. They will never ever get it and it's been like this all of my life.  Not to mention, they never made any effort when I was a kid to make sure that I was involved and exploring stuff because we were in poverty, and there are bigger things to worry about but sometimes I look at how much life I missed out on and now I'm forced to miss out on more so in the house I stay.

Advice? ,"I (23) am trying to figure out a rather complicated issue and could use some advice from this community. My sister (21) currently lives with my parents. She has been diagnosed with deletion of the short arm of chromosome 9 since she was 2, which came along with epilepsy, vitiligo, mild cp, legally blindness, ticks, and much more. My parents home is not a good place. Our mother is an opioid addict who abused all of us emotionally and financially, and me physically, while spouting that she was the perfect mother to the world. Many people saw through that but no one stepped up to help us. My mother's controlling abuse coupled with my younger sister's conditions essentially turned my younger sister into a super dependent which none of us fault her for. She cannot drive due to her diagnosis and struggled in school so my mother decided to drop her out of high school freshman year (I was away at college and no one told me till after) and has basically trapped her in the house since then. She has no community, no regular social interactions, no purpose, and you can see just how much that weighs on her. I used to take care of her when I lived at home and she still had that spark of life that I loved. I was on the track team and had her join the throwing team so that she could spend time with me after school. I'd take her out on sister dates, we shared a room all our lives, she mimicked everything I did and while younger me found it annoying, I learned to love it as I got older because she just wanted someone to show interest in her and want her around. She's my girl. I often consider her my child what with all that we've been through and how I had to take on a parental role very young. 

Now comes the parts where I could use advice: I want to move her in with me. I went to a service academy for college so I have no debt and work commercially in a very high paying field. I can afford to live practically anywhere in the US. I can afford to fully support her financially and that is my plan. I have a long term boyfriend (soon to be fiancé) that is 100% on board with this plan. We took her on a three week long trip to Disney and Universal Studios and Naples, FL so that she could get a reprieve from home and smile and so that I could see how she and my partner meshed and so that he could understand fully the level of commitment this decision is. And guys, he is all in :) I love that man. But the parts that are stumping me is the where, who, and whats:

Where do I buy a house to move her in with me? I've been researching best states for disability aid and care but the articles don't cover my points of interest. She needs to be able to get transportation whether that be by a state aid program (I know Delaware has motivCare and DART) or by public transportation. My goal is to give her the independence she never had and that means I don't want her to have to always rely on me to drive her places and feel guilty about doing so or unmotivated to do things because she doesn't want to be a bother (these were feelings our mother carved into us). This also plays into the quality of state programs and availability of care. Where have you found to be ideal areas to live that best suit your needs (she does not use any mobility aid so that is not a factor really) 

Who do I need to contact? She is currently on state disability insurance in Delaware but I know if I move her to another state ( which is the plan as Delaware is small and we do not want her to be in any proximity to our mother if I truly want to have success in her healing from it all) I have to transfer her benefits which as far as I know is only the insurance. I also want to set her up with a social worker so she gets the maximum benefit of advocacy for what is best for her and have no clue how to go about doing all of this. 

What do you think would be most beneficial to focus in on first? She does not need to work but I want her to have something that drives her, some passion or focus or goal and she has always wanted a job so I know I am going to be working on that with her but I don't think it should be my primary focus right off the bat of moving her to a new state. I have been looking into therapy specialties that might best apply to this situation as I am a strong advocate for therapy (have been in since I left home and it has helped bring back the light in my own eyes) and I believe that a trauma therapist would be best suited to start transitioning her out of the world my mother created for her. i understand this might be a controversial one but in the first 4 months of me being at college she gained almost 40lbs and it has gone up from there the longer I was away. I used to cook for the whole family and they resorted strictly to fast food and junk food when I left plus in hindsight all of the physical activity she did was when she would be mimicking me to spend time with me. And she had been diagnosed with depression a year into my time at college. All compounded together she has gained an unhealthy amount of weight that is further pressing on her existing diagnoses and making it hard for her to sleep and walk. She has told me how much she hates it. how much she hurts. But that she struggles with the food in the house and that she isn't allowed outside. It broke my heart when I first saw her after leaving for freshman year (for context I went to a 1 month bootcamp and then was not given my phone or social media access back till 8 months later as that is how my college ""indoctrinates"" you into the military) and I knew the moment I saw her that I had to get her out. That my worst fear of my mother turning on her in my absence had come true. But I want to get her involved in a workout class or a walking club or just anything she enjoys that keeps her active and I'll gladly be signing up with her if that is what she wants. Long and short of it: What aspects of moving her to a new area should I prioritize first. I obviously have a lot of goals and small things figured out but no grand plan and while everything does not have to go to plan, having one would greatly help me step into this. 

Thank you for reading all of this way and I appreciate any bits of advice. I love my sister so much and just want the best for her.  ",3,1egxm8o,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1egxm8o/advice/,0,1722458014.0

Excluded from family because of disability by brother [41/M]. What should I [34/F] do?,"Posted this in relationships and family first, but I didn't get a response...

My brother (41) and his wife (38) have made it quite clear that they don't want to see me for the past five years or so. They come to my parents' house a few times a year to visit, and when they're there, I can't visit.

They have a daughter (4) and a son (18 months), and as far as they know, I don't exist. They don't talk about me. They ask my parents (71 & 72/M & F) to remove photos of me when they visit. They think my brother is an only child.

Neither me or my parents have had any idea why this is going on. Both of my parents have asked my brother repeatedly about this, and he just stonewalls them. I have been ruminating about it for ages, trying to figure it out.

Something happened during a recent visit that revealed everything. My mum was serving her granddaughter some lunch, and she said to her, ""grandma, are you cold?"" My mum said something along the lines of, ""no sweetheart, there's just a part of my brain that doesn't work as well as yours"", and she was fine with that.

Both my mum and I have a hereditary essential tremor, which causes shaking. Mine is significantly worse than my mum's.

My brother got angry with her and said she can't say things like that around his daughter. My dad (able-bodied) overheard, and took my brother aside. He told him he can't speak to my mum like that. Then my dad clicked in, and asked if this was the reason I hadn't met his children.

My brother was sheepish, and yes, he and his wife want to protect their children from these things at such a young age, and considering we both have it, they don't want them to be fearful that they will also develop it.

It's worth noting that essential tremor isn't my only health issue - I have several, and they affect my balance and coordination to a noticeable extent. I also experience random jerking of my limbs. I also have invisible illnesses - SLE & endometriosis.

It was very clear that my SIL was bothered by this from the beginning - she used to stare at me across the table, and mum said she asked her many intrusive questions about my health.

Some background information - my SIL is very image-focused... spends a large portion of her income on designer bags and clothes. She's a lawyer. My parents are nothing like this. My brother is a politician and making his way up. Ironically, he advocates for disadvantaged Indigenous people.

They came to visit recently and my mum decided not to see them - she stayed with me the whole time. Afterwards they sent a framed photo of my dad and their kids without my mum in it.

I'm really shocked by this whole situation. I don't know what to do. I already carry so much shame from my health issues, and this is just making it worse. What would you recommend?

tl;dr: Brother & SIL won't let me meet their kids because of my disability. What are your suggestions?",23,1eghcz6,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eghcz6/excluded_from_family_because_of_disability_by/,13,1722411859.0

Would I benefit from a cane?,"First time poster here, technically not disabled but didn't know where else to ask. I have trouble walking, I only recently admitted to myself that it's not normal for a young adult not to be able to walk without discomfort/pain. I have had joint problems from childhood and was told I need more muscle and that will fix everything (it didn't) and because of it I have felt like my problems are my fault. Anyway, the longer I walk and stand the more I hurt, the more I hurt the wobblier I get (not to a point of falling though).

I have had few times when my legs hurt from walking so bad I couldn't leave home for a few days. I'm finally getting assessed so hopefully I get help soon. In the meanwhile I am trying to figure out if a cane could help me walk farther and easier, my both legs are equally bad and my wrists can only bear weight when completely straight so I guess it might not actually be helpful?",2,1eh1j4x,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eh1j4x/would_i_benefit_from_a_cane/,5,1722467771.0
How can I prove that I've been diagnosed with a disability if I cant get any access to documentation for it? ,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub to ask this but I can't think of another one. 


I'm 19. When I was in elementary school I was diagnosed with multiple disabilities but after elementary I was homeschooled and never got any kind of treatment for them. 


I moved away on the first month of this year and signed up for ged classes. During this I found out I could get accommodations for my disabilities. I needed documentation within five years of then but after i explained my situation they said they could work something out and told me to bring any documentation i could. I tried to get my mom to get me any kind of documentation proving I was diagnosed, she ignored my calls and texts until after the deadline I was given was over. 




I've now been accepted into a college and am already registered for classes. During orientation I chose not to disclose the disabilities because I knew I couldn't prove them. But I want to be able to actually request accommodations if I need them.

That is an ADA unit all the way back in December 2023.  this apartment building accepted all of my accommodations which I do appreciate they promise me that they were going to pay a certain accommodations which were the most important ones, one of them is the door there’s a certain system that has to be added to the door which would allow me to lock, unlock the door and open and close it. It was supposed to be done before I moved in when I arrived. They said there was an issue because I live in an ADA apartment that to install it  The workers had to be like ADA compliance or something like that. The property manager did find one but then they told me that now I have to pay for it which I was confused about because they told me that they were going to pay for it. They told me that they didn’t want to pay for it anymore because they noticed that I mentioned only the key lock system and not the opening system which would allow the door to open and close. It has been six months already and the door system has not been installed, and I told them that if they can pay half of it, then I can pay the other half because obviously as tenant it’s concerning for my safety. they said that now I have to pay for it because I agree to pay for the accommodations mind you this was when they promised that they were going to pay for the door. I don’t mind paying for the accommodations afterwards, but I think it’s unfair that they use that against me when it came to the door. Am I in the wrong?

Can I use a mobilty aid at school without parent support.?,"So, I have Chronic pain. I've had chronic pain since around 5th grade. My mom told me it was growing pains for years and so I tried to ""walk it off"". when I eventually got her to try anything she took me to a rheumatologist who basically just said that it could be eds but my muscles are really tight and that it's not autoimmune. My hips are out of place, most likely due my limp, and so one of my legs appears longer.

I gave up really looking for a diagnosis years ago. It only disappoints me every time and every time it's a negative result it just reinforces my mom's belief that nothing is wrong.

My mom is neglectful, and I don't just say that to be hurtful, her medical neglect is bad enough that I had gallstones, they turned into pancreatitis, and then that pancreatitis got bad, and then it turned into necrotizing pancreatitis and she still wouldn't do anything and I had to call an ambulance for myself. 

That was all when I was 14. I got my gallbladder removed after I spent 2 weeks in the hospital and had a picc and an nj tube. She sent me back to school the day after my cholecystectomy.

Anyway, I'm in 10th grade now, I asked my mom about getting a mobilty aid and she said that she didn't think I needed it and that I'm ""not some cripple that needs to use a device to get around"". Reminder, I have a limp and a messed up gait, everyone I know, except apparently my mom, knows that and can openly see that when I walk.

Well, I stopped caring for her opinion awhile back and so I bought myself a cane anyway. Originally I wanted to talk with my physical therapist about getting her opinion since she's a medical professional but since the convo with my mom was a bust I didn't really have that option.

So, I have it, i made sure to get the right size, and I've practiced walking with it and made sure I knew how to use it right. School is starting soon and I want to use it there, does anyone know if I can bring it to school without having to get my mom involved?

"Scooter and chair OOP, thanks insurance. ","My doc wrote me a prescription for a power chair/scooter. The insurance has played tennis with this for months. I accepted a job teaching littles and need it. My disability did not take the same break. 

So I hit eBay and fb marketplace. I found a scooter that was all but new and a lift that the gal sold me that I paid her asking price. It was low enough for a Catholic school teacher to afford. Then I later found a power chair that had been used once and the owner decided it was too big and didn’t want to use it. (It’s perfect.). They also sold it to me for a great price. 

Insurance refused figure out if my very limited walking/standing/being in incredible pain triggers “medical necessity.”  So with limited means, I outdid them and found what I needed. I will be in the classroom, on field trips, going on dates with my husband and all the things that we really haven’t done because I couldn’t. It was a huge chunk of savings to do this.

Wife's Disability Eligibility ,"Obligatory throw away account

I don't know what to do at this point. My (31m) wife (33f) is diagnosed ASD, Bi-polar depression and a couple other diagnosis. We have been together for about 7 years, married less than a week. Over that time I've watched her make great strides in her mental health in a lot of areas but I've watched her regress in a lot of others.

Back in 2017ish she worked a data entry job and it was perfect for her. She put her headphones on, did her work and no one bothered her. She had the job for years and then they eliminated her position. The experience has traumatized her. The sudden yank of the rug out from under her still haunts her to this day. 

Over the years she has held multiple jobs. These range from retail jobs, to data entry and most recently tutoring as she has a Master's in writing. The problem is that because of her mental health issues she eventually runs into problems a couple months into any job she has. These include feeling targeted by coworkers and bosses because she misunderstood something, interacting with the public in general and just struggling with her depression. It gets to a point where she quits the job because it is just destroying her health, both physical (she has a GI issue that responds to her mental health episodes)and mental. This just causes the cycle to repeat itself every few months.

The most recent issue is when they announced that they wouldn't be bringing her back next semester at the college she's tutoring at due to budget issues. This has sent her into another spiral and I just don't know what to do at this point. 

We've looked at disability in the past but it was denied and we didn't think it was worth the appeal at the time. Now though I don't know if I'm convinced she can hold a job even in her field as seen by this most recent issue. I know a steady source of income would improve her mental health but I don't know how she can obtain that.

Would it be worth speaking to a disability lawyer? Does she have a valid case? 

We are in New York state if that matters.",1,1egvo9v,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1egvo9v/wifes_disability_eligibility/,4,1722453261.0
ADA Seating,"I meet the requirements for ADA seating - can't walk long distances because of arthritis. Technically can't walk at all without pain lol.

People are likely to stand up - they did for the same band I went to a previous show for and obstructed my view. I don't use mobility aids though I probably need too lol.

Short term disability leave coordination with Child bonding leave,"I am going to be a daddy and have a situation.


- I’m currently on STD leave due to some health situation of mine. I am on a therapy and being treated. I need to extend the leave because I have some medical procedure to be done in the next few weeks.

- I’m also expecting my first new born in less than a week time.

I called my HR to extend my STD leave and push the date for the bonding leave to start at the end of the STD. 
HR said that the bonding leave has to start on the day the child is born and can’t start later. If started later the leave will be counted starting on the date of birth, so extending STD would not be helpful at all.

I did go through my employee handbook and benefits book, but can’t find any specific information that says,

- bonding leave has to start on the birthing day.

- neither there is a statement that says bonding leave can start anytime after the child is born but within a year.

Through google searches, and gemini, I have one general idea that bonding leave can start after the baby is born, but there is lack of such statement (and specifically on my employer) that says it specifically.

I want to find that information and update the HR that I found the information.

I want to ask fellow redditors,

- Would state level policies actually determine when I can start my bonding leave?
- what other sources would be relevant in my case?

If you can help if I rather provided name of my employer and my state, I can do that over private chat. 

Thanks to all in advance.

I can't tell if I'm disabled or not ,"I've (21m) been having leg pain for 5 years and fadigue and headaches for one. Basically my legs hurts when walking/standing. It usually starts at the ankle and progresses through the rest of the leg, but sometimes it starts in other places, so it doesn't have much of a pattern. It usually starts after a few minutes of walking, max 15min, but sometimes it's immediate and sometimes it takes longer. It doesn't prevent me from walking, it's never bad enough that my legs just fail, but it makes walking and getting out of the house in general extremely uncomfortable. I have to look for places to sit every 20 min and hope it gets slightly better so I can continue, but once it starts, it doesn't stop until I'm seated of an hour at least. 


I've been to an orthopedist, podiatrist, osteopath, general practioner, gynecologist, and had my veins checked, and nothing, I was just given magnesium and extra support for my shoes. At some point I gave up, or more so just hoped it would get better.


I just want to go on walks and appreciate them and not be in fear of having to stand on the bus or have to wait for the next in hope it's less full. But since my pain isn't constant, is unpredictable and it doesn't stop me from doing anything, I don't feel like I'm disabled, or that I should get mobility aids or ask for a seat on the bus. I know disability looks different for anyone, but not even my parents take me seriously, I'm just told to exercise more. I feel like I'll never be taken seriously on mobility aids if all I have is leg pain. Once my insurance is settled, I'll try and get second opinions, but I feel so lost.

"Access Pass For Disabled Individuals (National parks, BLM, and Forest Service), Free Lifetime Entrance","If you didn't know and you have been diagnosed with a permanent disability, you can get the [Access Pass](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/accessibility/interagency-access-pass.htm) - a no cost lifetime pass that grants free entrance to US National Parks and other Federal Recreational Lands (BLM, Forest Service, US Corp of Engineers, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Reclamation). It covers the pass-holder and if entrance fees are charged per vehicle, up to 4 adults in a noncommercial car along with them. It also sometimes provides discounts on other amenities within those parks like campsites.

I just got mine today and it was even easier than I thought it would be. I just visited the BLM office in my town, pulled up my ssdi ""proof of income"" letter on the SSA portal website showed them my ID matching my name on the letter and scrolled down to the part of the letter that said I receive it for disability, and Poof pass in my hand. This means me and my spouse will be taking a three day trip into Yellowstone part and saving $70 in entrance fees. If we decide to go down to Grand Tetons National Park below it, oh that would be free too. 

And it's good for life.

I feel like there aren't many ""perks"" to being disabled despite what many people think about us getting the ""best parking"". This really is a nice treat though, so along with the fact that my wheelchair cruises at 4-5mph which is faster than most people walk- I'll take it thanks! 

The caveats are:

* must be a US citizen or permanent resident
* be medically determined to have a permanent disability that severely limits one or more major life activities
* show proof of the above such a letter from your Dr, award letter from SSDI, SSI or the VA, Voc Rehab, or another state or federal agency (it must state that you are disabled)
* show a valid US ID such as Driver's License, State ID, Passport

How:

* get a pass in person at many agency offices and some park offices (list online) for free, you'll walk out pass in hand
* apply for a pass by mail (this option has  $10 processing and postage fee), pass will be mailed to you
* apply for a pass online (this options also has a $10 processing and postage fee), pass will be mailed to you

What Won't Work:

* you can't get one with just your disabled parking permit sadly

Question about LT disability coverage through employer,"Hi,

I am hoping for some advice from this great community on my situation and the language in my long term disability policy through my employer.

Background: I have diagnoses from my psych for PTSD, anxiety & depression. Stemmed from being sexually abused for years by a gymnastics coach. I have been in therapy and seeing a psych for a couple years and on medication, so diagnoses i’m sure are in my medical records.

I started a new job in Nov 2023. 
I have been really struggling with my condition of late, with severe anxiety, panic attacks, social anxiety, and debilitating depression that is affecting my ability to maintain my work and parenting responsibilities, although my performance at work is ok (part of my anxiety is I am constantly in fear of bad performance, losing my job, etc which paralyzes me and causes me to panic, dissociate and be terrified to interact with people. The dissociation is affecting my ability to remember simple instructions, drive without getting lost, etc. Therapy and medications are not really helping so far and I am worried about my financial ability to provide for my 2 kids and so I have looked into the disability insurance provided through my employer (provided by Lincoln)

My long term disability insurance through my employer (provided by Lincoln) reads as follows:

“Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion(s)

This policy will not cover any Disability or Partial Disability:

1. Which is caused by, or results from, a Pre-Existing Condition; AND

2. Which begins in the first 12 months immediately after the covered person’s effective date of coverage.”

The policy does cover mental health for up to 24 months. It says they do a 90 look back from your start date to see if a diagnosis is pre-existing

My question: Does this mean I am never eligible for disability coverage because I have been treated for these diagnoses before I started my job? Or does it mean I could be eligible come Nov 2024, when I have been with the company 12 months? The “AND” in part 1 is confusing to me.

Would REALLY appreciate help on what this language means from those of you who know the legal stuff in these policies. 

I’m feeling pretty desperate and just want to know if this is even an option for me come November 2024 when I have been with the company for a full year.

I'm eager to hear feedback from the community to help me refine this feature. As it stands, the facial recognition can detect the following gestures:

* Head rotation and eye tracking for movement
* Opening your mouth, raising your eyebrows, and winking with the left or right eye for button inputs

Please note that since this is an experimental feature, there may be some issues or bugs. Your feedback will be invaluable in helping us improve it.

How to Make Abled Partner Feel Cherished,"Hello! I am 28 years old and I have ankylosing spondylitis (AS) along with some pretty debilitating mental health issues and audhd (autism + adhd). 

I felt like this would be the best place to get some advice from fellow disabled friends and potentially abled partners that are in this sub! My partner is 27, able bodied, and is the working one. We currently live with her dad for the moment so stuff like doing household chores isn’t really an issue because her dad keeps the house pretty much spotless. I just gather dishes from the bedroom and take them when I’m able to. 

I just want to make her feel loved and appreciated and cherished. I tell her how much I love her and appreciate her all the time and how much she does for me and supports me, but I want to do something special for her! I have no income of my own, so gifts or things of the sort are pretty iffy since it kind of just feels like I’m taking her money to buy her something. 

Looking for cheap, fun things we can do together that aren’t too hard on the body and can help me show her that I am so so so grateful for everything she does for me. Please leave suggestions and such! Appreciated. ❤️ ",19,1efxnq5,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1efxnq5/how_to_make_abled_partner_feel_cherished/,10,1722356600.0
How to prevent concussions,"I'm not looking for medical advice but any non medical strategies you might use to help you. 

I currently have my 4th or 5th concussion I've had in the last 6 months. I'm not sure exactly, it's hard for me to remember at the moment.

I can't figure out how to keep them from happening. I have episodes, somewhere between fainting and a functional seizure, where I essentially lose control of my body and fall or hit against things around me. I'll shake/spasms to the point that even if I'm just sitting or even sometimes laying I hit my head multiple times in a short period, which is how I've gotten most of my concussions. 

This concussion was caused because an episode started while I was on the stairs so I had to half slide half fall down the stairs to prevent a worse injury, and then I sat/laid on the bottom step for more than an hour before I recovered enough to ask for help to get safely back to my room.

I have some warning before these episodes but one of the first signs is I loose a lot of motor control, which includes my ability to talk clearly, so I can't really communicate what's going on to people around me to ask them to help in the moment. I also generally can't walk to a safe environment once the episode has began. So generally I'll try to sit or lay down the best I can, but I often still end up hitting my head either on the way down or after I've laid down just trying to move at all. 

I also just have full body tics/spasms where I'll kinda stumble backwards until I hit something, often with my head. 

What I'm diagnosed with is FND that causes these, but that doesn't really tell me what to do about them. 

I just don't know what to do to prevent this. I can't keep it up because multiple concussions is not good or sustainable. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can manage this? I am also going to the doctor in a couple days and I'm going to discuss it with them, but so far no doctor has had anything more helpful than ""try to lay down when it's happening"".

Getting over the fear of learning to drive again after becoming disabled from a car accident. Any similar experiences? ,"I got into a severe car crash over 5 years ago, and when I woke up I learned both of my legs needed to be amputated above the knee. 

I was devastated, and I knew I had a very long road ahead of me in terms of recovery, but I accepted the situation and tried to bottle the trauma. I eventually got prosthetic legs, had them gradually upgraded as I re-learned how to walk, and I'm happily independent now. I practice walking daily, am living with my wife, have a remote professional job, and plan on starting a family. 



Regardless, since the accident, I developed a deep fear of getting in the driver's seat again, feeling a sense of guilt and self-hate at myself. Initially, I felt infantilized by my family who felt that I shouldn't be driving with no legs, but after seeing the modern ease of accessibility for amputees, they changed their mind. However, I myself could never fully shake off the fear and the embarrassment at myself for having lost my legs in my prime due to car accident. Although my family modified my car to include hand controls and I worked with my OT to get my prosthetics suitable for driving, I still rarely drive for this reason.



Given that I plan on starting a family, I can't keep on pushing off necessary responsibilities forever out of fear at this point, and need to fully push towards getting my life back together from before my accident. I have begun taking initiative with very short distance drives about once a month and my anxiety about it has been slowly easing, and my wife has been extremely supportive along the way, but I'm wondering if anyone else has been in a similar spot before.",12,1efxy1k,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1efxy1k/getting_over_the_fear_of_learning_to_drive_again/,2,1722357291.0

My disability is ruining my life,"I was born with a bone deformity. 

All my joints are a bit out of place, which means they dislocate real easily. My bones break easier too. I can't lift heavy stuff, just cat litter is too much. I can't run, I can't make any twist motions, so no roller, no bicycle, no skiing, almost no dancing ect.

Apps like Finch and Moodle made me realize through writing prompts, that my childhood dreams have all been stopped by my disability. 

I always wanted to skate and roller skate because of Tony Hawk's games. I've also always wanted to do burlesque and be a dancer. None are possible for me.

Years of physical therapy didn't help much. You can't fix displaced bones. Stretching worsen my joint instability, so I can't even be flexible.

I'm really, very good at art, since I couldn't move much since birth. But it's not bringing me the joy I seek. 

I've wanted to move, dance, be super flexible and skate before understanding that I was badly disabled. God knows I tried and hurt myself badly many times when I was a kid.

I can't even play skating games or go see burlesque shows anymore, because of how bitter it makes me.

I also get this desire to move and release pant up energy or negative emotions. The best alternative I found was to sing very loudly (even though I'm terrible at it lol).

I just wish I wasn't born disabled.",29,1efp2dr,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1efp2dr/my_disability_is_ruining_my_life/,25,1722331982.0

Every day, our existence is threatened by the government in this country. With the swipe of a pen, we could be forced into a nursing home because our in-home services are cut. I know some people would say, ""We won't let that happen!"" But let's be honest, they all struggle too and need to take care of their table. This is the fear the disability community lives with daily.

Starting out with mobility aids,"This is my first time posting here kinda nervous but I want to start using mobility aids to help me. I have hypermobility and am being referred to a specialist to confirm if it is EDS, I'm suspected to have POTs too and I have a chronic pain disorder. I've been in pain my whole life and walking and going out has been a massive struggle for me. The problem is my family don't care to see my issues as a disability. I've practically been ignored in terms of my health and they are reluctant on me using mobility aids such as crutches or a cane. I'm moving out next month so hopefully I can get the support I need when I move. I've been using compression bandages but they don't work aswell so I'm thinking of getting more sturdy knee braces as I think it'll help with my walking.

I really want to get a cane or crutches to help with bad pain days and make it so I don't have to stay in my bed all day but I'm worried about what other people would think. I'm open to any advice or recommendations from people :)

"I can’t wash my own hair, should I cut my hair short? ","I have severe fibromyalgia (among other things) and lately, exasperated by a job I physically can’t keep up with and am not able to use my mobility aids at, it’s gotten so bad it’s nearly unmanageable. I feel like I’m just crying every day because the pain is so bad but an issue I’m having particularly recently is weakness and pain in my arms. I’ll try carrying something like a half gallon of tea to my fridge and it just burns with pain from the exertion, or pick up tongs and doing motions ro cook my food at kbbq; everyday average actions and motions are becoming so so painful, but the thing hurting a lot is washing my hair. I’m autistic with medium support needs and especially as a kid I always struggled to take care of myself and as an adult I’m really sensitive to looking greasy or smelling bad. As a kid I used to her big rats nests from struggling to shower and brush my own hair that would then have to be forcibly and painfully brushed out by a parent or cut out, and my hair was often forcibly cut short because I couldn’t take care of it and the cut off ponytails were kept by my parent and shown to me in a baggie as a reminder of how bad I was at taking care of my hair/self. I guess because of this I feel really sensitive about my hair in general. I’ve been struggling so much to wash my hair and it hurts so much I’ve been considering just cutting it short but I also have been trying to grow it out for so long even though I know it’s not very healthy hair and it’s pretty damaged. 
I just don’t see another solution other than cutting it short because washing it is so painful. I don’t wash it every day but it can’t be avoided, I know I’d have to wash it even if short but at least then it would be less and I won’t be having to keep my arms held up at my head as long as I do now, which is the thing I’m struggling with. 
I have a shower chair but it’s the physical act of raising my arms and doing hand movements that I’m struggling so much with; my arms just get so weak and tired and they start to burn and ache it’s so painful. I guess I’m just here to rant. If you’ve been in a similar position as me I’d love to hear from you. I feel like my hair is how I express myself the most, I like to color it fun colors, but I also just struggle so much to take care of it because of the pain so that also means styling it in ways I want or doing extra hair care like oil or conditioning treatments; it’s just too much energy/work I don’t have. 😔

Seeing wrestling live and epilepsy.,Hi everyone. I'm thinking about taking my nephew (10 m) to a WWE event the next time they're in the area (Ontario Canada half way between Toronto and Montreal so could go either way) however I'm concerned about the pyro causing him a seizure as I know it's pretty Loud esp at the start of Raw/SmackDown when they set off a bunch of pyro. We would be sitting further up due to pricing and he will be wearing noise cancelling headphones as he's autistic and epileptic but is not photo sensitive (the kind where u can't watch flashing lights or Ull have a seizure). However has had seizures when around him is too loud as it overwhelmes him. My question is has anyone had experience with this and is there medical help quickly to fans who aren't around ring side.

Short Term Disability While Figuring Out Dignosis,"I am working with Lincoln Financial insurance that is provided through my employer. 

I had been seeing my PC doctor about a month before my first claim was filed in April. She started the process of referring me to a Rheumatologist due to symptoms and blood work and signed off on claim #1 for a week of std that was approved. Rheum was only able to get me in June. 

Rheum appointment was early June and suspected autoimmune/ Rheumatoid Arthritis more testing to be done. 

During this time in June I tried returning to work for two weeks and thing suddenly got so much worse. And I filed another claim early July due to horrible symptoms. 


But, scheduling bloodwork and more testing/appointments is slow and hard to get on the schedule. 

Lincoln wants medical documents and I’m assuming a concrete diagnosis. 

We are obviously in the process of doing that. 

But, I’m not getting paid because they want more documents/ different documents, on top of horrible communication, stalling, losing documents and not telling me what they need. 

I’m stressing that they will deny me for the month and a half I am out because I don’t have an official diagnosis- just what my doctor suspected at first- Raynauds which didn’t end up being the case. Rheum is in early testing since then and my next appointment isn’t for a while. I’m still super sick. 


This is all really hard for me to understand and Lincoln gets short with me like I should know all the terminology. 

Any advice for how to explain and prove I am unwell enough to not work when doctors are still working on diagnosing? 

Do I have to have specific diagnosis DURING the time of my leave? 

What can I ask my doctor for and should I anticipate being taken advantage of being denied by Lincoln?

Seeking thoughts on a self determination tactic by a group home.,"A supportive housing setting manager requested that a young adult with Intellectual Disability refrain from raising concerns with family even though the concerns are not being addressed or are not being addressed in a timely manner. The excuse was that it was in the young adult with the Disability’s best interest to not bother the parent with their concerns.

The parent became aware of the issue on their own observation during a visit but said nothing, then the person with ID mentioned it as a concern and thus the parent notified the parties responsible as a heads up that the concern remains a health and safety issue. Thus the home felt warranted to request that concerns (there were others) not be raised with the parent.

We tell kids don’t listen when someone tells you to keep secrets from your parents. While an argument could be made that this is in aid of self determination, I feel that this request hovers over a thin line as ID persons are not generally cognitively higher than a 5th grader. As a result they wouldn’t be able to rationalize what can and cannot be said to the parent and may not feel comfortable seeking help when most needed for fear of breaking this arbitrary rule imposed on them.

Like I can do it but it's really painful. My lower back also starts hurting and continuously gets worse if I stand up for too long, same with my knees. I've been looking into canes and crutches and whatnot but I don't want to take away resources from people who might need them more, especially since I haven't been diagnosed with literally anything at all.

How to live a fulfilling life when in a wheelchair?,"I’m not trying to be dramatic! And I know that if people knew me irl they’d probably say that I am better off than a lot of people (physically) but recently I can’t help but feel completely hopeless.

Long story short - I’m in a wheelchair and I just don’t see much hope for a fun life in the future.

I live at home, in a small town with nothing around it. I’m not a millionaire so I can’t just pay my way to a simple life of freedom. There’s no public transport and if there was, where would I go? And why?

And the thing that pisses me off the most - even if I do go outside far from home I have to either: A) dehydrate myself or B) plan my day around drinking water and going to the bathroom or C) just not bother. All because of stupid public toilets and their lack of accessibility.

I have no friends. I have no reason to go outside and get a life. I don’t even know how to, but I also kind of do…?

It’s a mixture of my personality and my disability. I think my personality that holds me back mentally accounts for the lack of mental disability so you know just to get the full package of “hey you’re physically held back….and also your mindset is fucked”

So how do I ever look at the future and have hope? How do I have confidence that I’m not going to waste my life? How do I get my own life? How do I change? When will I finally be comfortable in my life and free. 

It’s not just a matter of thinking “I’m not behind in life”. No I guess not, but it’s not like I could suddenly change my life. Certainly doesn’t feel that way anyway.

What do you look forward to?,"I’m still in the middle of the process of adjusting to having limited mobility for an undefined, potentially indefinite amount of time. I’m 8.5 months in and I notice that a decent part of the damage to my mental health is from not feeling like I have anything to look forward to, because most of the things I used to look forward to are effectively not possible anymore since most of them required well…normal mobility.

All of my mindspace is just focused on managing my day-to-day in terms of managing pain, keeping up at work, keeping up with physical therapy, and trying to not make my condition worse. I don’t know what to strive for or dream about anymore. All I see are current and future increasing responsibilities that I’m not sure I’ll be able to handle in light of my capabilities decreasing. I still watch videos and read about stuff I’m interested in as a distraction, but since I can’t take part in these things anymore, they aren’t things I look forward to anymore.

does anyone have shoe recommendations for AFOs?,"i got afos at the beginning of the month and i’ve been struggling since then to find shoes.

what counts as needing assistance on ADLs? ,"so I have declined a lot lately in my health, and when asked I keep saying that i’m independent but i’m not sure if I am anymore. I’m just gonna run down the list to see if i’m doing okay or worse then I thought. (I recognize I could just be in major denial because I hate asking for help with things) 

1. Bathing: I still can technically due this unassisted but I’ve had to reduce the amount of showers I take to every other other day or every 3 days because it’s so exhausting and even the showers I do take have gotten to where my hair is still greasy afterwards cause it’s too exhausting to throughly wash it. My beard and hair are also a mess because I haven’t been able to leave the house to go to a barber or had the energy to style it or shave. (I have also been using a lot of bath wipes) 

2. Dressing: I can get clothes on and off independently but I often end up wearing them days on end due to reasons above

3 Feeding: I get 100% of calories from my feeding tube, I can normally set up the feeds by myself but I keep missing days due to falling asleep before it’s set up. 

4 Toileting: so far doing okay with this one, no accidents but occasionally need help to get to the bathroom. (not very often) 

5 Moving around: I use a wheelchair for any distance longer then across a room, and a crutch for anything shorter then that. In all reality I don’t move around that much anymore though. I was working 10 hours a week on an extremely easy job but had to quit a few days ago due to ems having to be called for the second time on me at work. I spend around 70% of my day in bed and the rest on the couch or practicing piano. 

6 transferring: seems okay, I haven’t fallen in a way that’s killed me or broken any bones 🤷🏼‍♂️ 

(for more context I also haven’t been able to do household chores like the majority of laundry or dishes. I can fold the laundry and put it in drawers but I can’t get to the washing machines because they are downstairs, so my roommates have had to take on a lot of my chores)

"Do you know any programs that will take in, train, and rehome service dogs? ","I got a dog in the begging of November last year with the intention of training her to be my service dog, but we arent a good match.

We've got her to the point that she is mostly neutral about people. Is good about leaving food alone. Gives good attention when working (with a few distractions - she needs more training when it comes to other dogs or people calling out to her.) She sits when weve been stopped for too long, lays down if its longer. She has a decent down stay but its not perfect. She provides pressure well, and comes up and nudges and licks and distracts when having a panic attack/breakdown/ptsd responce. It doesnt have to be visibly an issue either. She knows how to check rooms, and gaurds behind you when your back is to a door. She sits outside of the bathroom if youre in a house, and does great in public stalls even if theyre the small ones. 
Shes not perfect (she still gets excited about her food, and about other dogs) but would do well with a proper trainer, and I genuienly think she would be a great service dog for someone, its just not working out for us as a pair. 

That being said if you know of a program that would take her in and finish her training I would love to know.

Should I consider mobility aids?,"Hey! So i guess for context, im a 17 yr old AFAB(now nb), and i live in the UK. I have scoliosis of a 23° angle if that means anything to anyone, and i have hypermobility. 

While i was younger, my disabilties were mostly manageable, though sometimes/during different activities, it was almost unbearable due to pain. Now that im older, i feel like my symptoms are gradually worsening. 

For the last maybe 4 years, things like walking for more than 20 minutes nonstop becomes painful, and anything more than an hour brings me to tears. The pain is mostly in my lower back(where my curvature is), the connection point of my back to my hips, and any other connection point in my legs. Standing still becomes agony after a while, i cant  lie on solid ground(grass, carpet floor ect) for more then a few minutes without having to be pulled up and literally yelling from the sudden burst of pain from my hips. Sometimes even my bed is uncomfortable to lie on my back with. My knees generally have been playing up more, and all of my joints have been aching regularly from nothing in particular. 

The most worrying thing for me has been that my legs buckle, usually at the knees. Now, theyve been doing this occasionally for a few months, but only a week ago, i had a weird time where they just started giving out constantly. About halfway through the day at school(i do art and usually stay in the same building so i hadnt been going up many stairs or anything, i was just working) i got up to stretch my legs like i do usually, but as i was pacing the room, i got a slight twinge in my hip, and felt one of my knees buckle. It wasnt enough to make me fall, but i stumbled before being able to right myself. I didnt lose use of my leg for very long at all, it just gave out and then started working again, but it was considerably more unstable. I ushered myself to my chair and sat down while i tried to figure out why it did that. After a minute i got up again, and felt like i couldnt balance easily at all, like enough to make me sit back down. As the day went on, this continued to happen, swapping between both legs, and generally feeling pretty unstable. I fell down once because of the buckles, and had quite a few close calls. My friends were concerned enough that they wouldnt let me carry my hot food. It was happening about 10 times every 15-20 mins, and lasted for a few hours. Kind of unrelated but my neck was also jerking every so often(i have this thing where my neck will suddenly jerk so my head is resting on one of my shoulders, but its not very concerning to me). Ever since then my knees have sort of been weird, they ache more than they did before hand. 

My friends think I need a cane, and im inclined to believe them, but im not sure. I guess because my syptoms ""arent that bad"" i feel a little like a poser asking for a mobility aid, but on the other side, i know that i probably either need that or some intervention. My mum is supposed to be calling a physiotherapist, as my doctor has told me that would be the best cause of action. 

But if im honest, im starting to think i might need more than a cane and some physiotherapy. But im honestly not sure, i guess im asking someone who might have more experience than i do.

Are we overreacting?,"
I have a nephew that has a neurological disability and has been called the hard r word by his own family. They allow this child to watch a YouTube puppet named Jeffrey. He wears a helmet, nothing wrong with that but our problem lies in this character also has a pencil jammed up their nose and is wearing a diaper on the outside of their clothes.

My partner and I have brought up many times that we don’t feel comfortable with our child around that ignorant character. The character is depicted as a nuisance and “parents” have tried abandoning him.
The puppet is purchasable.

We’ve again brought up how this puppet is an ignorant depiction of someone with a mental and neurological disability.

I have adhd and ocd I’ve been called the r word many times. 

The puppet has been purchased and this feels like a big fuck you. And we are being told my partner and I that we are being over dramatic.

Advice on Living Arrangements and Home Assistance,"I am a disabled veteran in Georgia with a 90% rating, waiting for an appeal that will get me to 100%, receive payments from a commercial disability insurance policy from my last employer, and I am waiting for a decision on SSDI. My symptoms have been slowly getting worse for over 20 years but over the last six months, enough of them have gotten bad enough that I am no longer independent. Should I consider asking a family member to move in, live here for free, and provide me support? Or instead should I look to hire someone to provide the support and care I need?  
  
For example, up until about two years ago, I would have one or two periods lasting 3-10 days each for any year where I was too symptomatic to drive myself, make food, clean, do laundry, etc. I would just ask for help from friends and family for those few days. Last year, the periods go a little more severe and more frequent - it happened about every other month. But for the past month, I have now had symptoms get so bad that they impact daily life and they aren't going away. 

If it matters, I have Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) and have to get IVIg infusions every three weeks to slow to lose of use of my muscles. I also have peripheral sensory neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy that is slowly worsening. I have COPD and Asthma, GERD, PTSD, Fibromyalgia, Hemolytic Anemia, and horrible fatigue with brain fog. Physical exertion caused my O2 to drop and I get light-headed, dizzy, fatigued, and start wheezing. If I don't stop, my O2 drops low enough that I pass out. Even if I do stop, it takes days for me to recover from my muscles aching, feeling full, clumsiness, horrible muscle spasming, and muscle and joint pain.   
  
Mental exertion gives me migraine headaches after about 30-45 minutes that take hours to days to go away. Reading a book or even having to focus too hard filling out a form for too long can trigger this. Heck - even playing a strategy video game for more than about 30 minutes can trigger it.

My quality of life has dropped super low - I'm basically a lump that watches TV and occasionally plays video games - but my therapist does a good job helping me maintain perspective and keep a good attitude. 

But it has been over five weeks now that they symptoms have been their worst and it isn't letting up or getting better like it always has before. I can't get in to see my Neurologist until January, the Rheumatologist and Hematologist have both given the ""everything within my specialty is being managed"", and the Pulmonologist has ordered a new Pulmonary Function Test that I take on Thursday. Pain Management has taken away the Percocet they previously prescribed for breakthrough pain and left me with just the Belbuca twice a day that used to manage my pain but now leaves me constantly at a pain level of 5-9 at any given moment. Oh, and the Neurologist stopped the muscle relaxers two appointments ago because I was still having spasms even on the maximum dose.  
  
I am now at the point that I am struggling to even wipe myself after going to the bathroom (have been recommended a bidet) or even make it across the room. Cooking, laundry, cleaning, driving, etc. is all out of the question. I can still wash myself in a bath but fear falling too much to shower anymore -- but washing is a struggle. Heck, when my pain is REALLY bad, even taking my meds and brushing my teeth is a struggle. 

I have four adult children but two each have a child under one year old and the other two are ... not dependable. When they previously offered to help and I took up the offer, they didn't help. 

My daughter with the older child has said that if I buy a house with an in-law suite, she would be willing to move her family (her, her husband, the toddler) into the rest of the house and she would take care of me. It's a very generous offer, but I'm nervous that once I make that decision and we move in, I am stuck with that solution for the rest of my life. If she runs into problems, I'm stuck with no backup. I think she is more excited about the prospect of a free house and a potential stipend from the VA for providing my care.

Where do I start on getting assistance? I think the VA has a hotline I can call. Do I start there? How does one find people you can trust to come into your home and provide assistance or drive you around when you can't take care of yourself? What red flags do I look for and what do I do if I see them once I invite these helpers into my home?

Should I be looking at an assisted living situation? I'm only in my 50s but I was considering a 55+ community anyway.

I never thought one injury would change my life so much for so long ,"I torn my ACL, MCL and injured MM when I fell down on uneven ground after a jump. I was playing badminton with my friends. Then I fell, heard a “pop” sound and my knee had lost stability. I wasn’t able to bend it fully, the pain was there but I was pumped with adrenaline. I walked 3 km home. Then it only got worse. 5 days after injury I went to the hospital after my USG and X-ray results came back. I got a mechanical brace and two crutches. Most likely I’m gonna need surgery.

It feels so weird that one moment, one fall has consequences that severe. On the X-ray I found out I have significant degenerative changes in my joint. It made me think that yes in fact I experienced joint pain since I was a kid once a while but I had never given it much thought. 

I’m an active person. I loved walking. I often climb - mostly bouldering. I go to the gym often. My legs were always something I was proud of. I could lift very heavy. I got visible muscles even with father high BF%. I try to cheer up myself that I still can do a big part of my usual activities but deep down I’m terrified and in denial. 

It’s all new to me. I feel weird when people are giving me dirty looks when I take my crutches in one hand and walk upstairs without them.

Fold up powered wheelchair?,"I have severe MECFS. My legs work in that I can stand fit short periods if I *must*, and I can walk maybe 20m or so from a car park to a doctors office.

Pushing my own wheelchair is going to wear me out just the same. But if I had a powered chair I could maybe go a little further.

Are there any fold up chairs I could keep in the boot of the car as a backup?

Cane using family member seems to be slamming it down while walking,"A family member of mine now needs a cane for walking. I'm glad they are using an aid, but I've been in an awkward and frustrating situation because of it. 

When they walk, they slam the cane down heavily into the floor. As a result of the magnitude of the sound, I've been getting frequent migraines whenever I'm with them. The mix of loud, sudden sharp noise and overstimulation of it's frequency has made me hyper focused on the sound and personally miserable. I suspect they are not effected as much by the sound because of their hearing.

Not only is it disruptive, I'm starting to worry that it may be indicative to improper cane use. Slamming it like that could be hurting their arms and hands, or perhaps they are not using it properly for their need.

The problem is, I've mentioned it once before and they told me they can't stop. I'm now horribly terrified of asking or inquiring further and I've been avoiding them in order to stop the migraines. I just want to tell them in a way that doesn't come out as offensive, insulting, or embarrassing.

Please help, I'm not sure what to do..",26,1eeacdr,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1eeacdr/cane_using_family_member_seems_to_be_slamming_it/,41,1722181322.0
Is it common that you’re getting tired so quickly while walking with crutches?,"I have torn ACL,MCL and injured MM. I got a knee brace and was told to use crutches when walking for longer distances. First few days I haven’t figured out yet how should I use them and I had literally treated them as a substitute for my injured leg. So I was ""jumping"" and after 20 meters I was sweating and this technique made me even more unstable than without crutches. Later on I got a grip of the idea that I should use crutches to help my injured leg not replace it. Yet still I find it super tiresome and I have to take a brake while going on the street to let my hands rest. I work out and have relatively strong upper body.

What is the best way to portray disability in creative writing?,"Hi, I'm a (non-disabled) creative writer who is currently planning out a story where there are multiple disabled characters (or at least, considered ""disabled"" in their world.) I want to portray these disabilities as realistically and respectfully as possible. I'm sorry if this post is too long.

Here is my current philosophy on writing disabled characters - please point out anything I need to change or add, I'd LOVE to hear it.

- **A character shouldn't be defined by their disability.** Their disability doesn't make up their identity. There's so much more to them other than ""character with so-and-so condition"". Example: This character is female, likes golf, is a cat lover, very enthusiastic and energetic, and is deaf in one ear. The ""deaf in one ear"" part doesn't define her whole character.

- **They should still be treated like normal people despite being accommodated.** They shouldn't be showered with sympathy and pity every waking moment of their lives.

- **If they do something bad, their disability doesn't exempt it.** In accordance with the point above, being disabled doesn't excuse bad actions. 

- **A disability isn't an ""all or nothing"" thing.** Characters can be *partially* disabled.

- **Disabilities don't need backstories.** Long, tragic backstories aren't necessary. 

- **Simple things normal people overlook can be extremely difficult for those with certain disabilities.** I'm definitely planning on having ""normal"" people (or people who are considered normal in that world, at least) interact with the disabled people and gradually understand that simple things, like putting on your shoes, communication, etc. can be much harder for them.

- **Depending on culture, stereotypes, etc. disabled people will probably be treated badly in certain cases.** (Or, in reverse - disabled people are treated with too much sympathy to the point where it becomes sickening).

- **No, you don't have to ""magically cure"" the disabilities for the sake of yay, happy ending!** I hate this trope if you want me to be honest, unless it's done super well.

(I feel like I'm missing a lot of important points here.)

Current ideas for characters:

- A young boy whose medical condition prevents him from using a specific ability called ""True Singing"", which makes him ""disabled"", as well as gives him other physical side effects that impact him on a daily basis (I'm thinking chronic pain or mobility issues). Despite this, he's managed to create a fulfilling life outside of his disability, even collaborating with other professional ""True Singers"". He actually gets along with them pretty well and hates receiving pity for his disability.

- A deeply embittered woman who is part of a faction of those who are ""disabled"", typically for being incapable of using the ""True Singing"" ability. She is somewhat antagonistic, treating anyone who is ""normal"" terribly and also being infuriated at other disabled individuals who don't passionately hate the ""normal"" people. Pretty much everyone in the outcast faction hates her for her terrible attitude and complete lack of empathy despite being considered disabled themselves.

Anything else I should add? Please let me know.

How to explain invisible illness,"My partner is disabled. He suffers from very severe migraines, joint paint and chronic fatigue. He's an ambulatory wheelchair user. He also has a number of mental issues. 

We recently moved in together and my family is struggling to understand.

They ask me how I know it's not psychosomatic, or they say stuff (even directly to him) like ""You don't look in pain"". Sometimes they mean well, sometimes not, in any case it's troublesome and doesn't help him at all.
Even the dr at his latest appointment asked him if he was in pain at that moment because he didn't look like he was in pain (he was masking just to function).

And then if he can't mask or has flare ups they're just taken aback by it. Like, if he has to go to the bathroom to throw up, or is suddenly moaning on the stairs, they'll come ask me if I know and why I'm not doing something about it,  and I'm like ""cause that's normal for him and part of our bad day routine?"".

Most recently I had an argument with my dad because he showed up to our house without warning, rang the doorbell and my bf ignored it because he didn't know who it was. 

He came to me saying I have to explain to him that it's rude not to go open the doorbell. My bf was in bed, having a bed day, getting up takes him 10-15 minutes and there's a flight of stairs to go see who's at the door. That takes a lot of energy, not to mention the fact that his routine experience is that by time he gets to the door whoever it was has already left, so he just ignores the doorbell, unless it's a planned visit (in which case he's usually already up and waiting somewhere near the door).

How do I explain this so they'd understand?

My dad is old and hyperactive, he never understood the fact that people need rest and always call everyone lazy for stuff like sleeping until 10 on the weekend.
I dunno how to explain to him that my bf is not being rude or lazy if he doesn't get up to say hello.
(That's all he wanted, the visit wasn't for anything he needed).

"What's your favourite ""luxury"" that aids you?","I'm coming into some back-pay very soon and I'm again looking at all the things that I've at some point considered might help me. But I don't want to buy things that are actually a gimmick or turn out to be useless. Obviously no one can say specifically what will help someone else, but I'm interested to know what you've bought or use that might be considered ""luxury"" to someone else but is an aid/pain relief to you? 

For example, I do a weekly floatation tank session because it eased the pain from my spinal issues and relieves my joints, but I've been told by multiple people that it's a spa treatment and therefore an ""unnecessary luxury"" and not a disability aid.
I also have an IR lamp for joint pain which (able) people have told me is a beauty gimmick.

My partner’s internalized ableism is making me miserable and I don’t know how to address it without getting shut down,"My (29F) partner (34M) and I both got diagnosed with ADHD last year. I think both of us knew something was afoot after a few years of starting to consume disability content. Lots of “huh, that sounds like me” when other people shared their stories. We both got assessed—my partner did it about 6 months before I did—and once he had a diagnosis, I think it was a huge relief for him. Having answers is great and can explain a huge amount of struggle, so I was thrilled for him. 

He has been homebound with GAD and depression for about three years and now has this ADHD diagnosis. During this time, I have been supporting us on a single income, doing a majority of the housework, cooking most meals, etc. I am in a graduate program earning a degree in my current field, I work a full-time design job, and I also teach college classes part-time.  I started therapy last year with a (mis)diagnosis of GAD and Bipolar II, and I developed several coping skills that have made doing all of this possible. I feel pleased with the accommodations I’ve created for myself to ease stress and the boundaries I’ve set to ensure I have capacity to enjoy things I love on top of supporting both of us. 

In the last six months, I have noticed that my partner calls upon his disability to explain away my concerns with our dynamic and some of his behaviors. An example would be conversations around housework and self-care. When I have asked him to start putting his dishes in the dishwasher or shower or change his clothes, he says, “Babe, I have a disability that prevents me from forming habits like that.” Or when I have asked him repeatedly to stop doing things to me like licking, pinching, or making mouth noises in my ear, which all feel like sensory nightmares to me, he brushes it off, saying, “I have a disability that literally makes me impulsive, I can’t stop it.” 

When I try to broach conversations around coping skills, therapy or resiliency skills, he ends the conversation by saying, “have you tried using a planner?” in a mocking tone. Medication has been a struggle for him as a result of some neurological side effects, so we don’t have that conversation much anymore. 

To me, having done a lot of work around accessibility and neurodiversity not just as a neurodiverse person but also as a professional and an educator, it reeks of internalized ableism. I find it incredibly insulting to hear him talk about himself like he has no control over himself or his life (I sense some fixed-mindset thinking in there, too). It’s also discouraging and makes me feel hopeless that it will always be like this. 

Because he doesn’t think he is able to help with housework because of his disability and because he continuously disrespects my personal space and body autonomy because of his disability, I find myself struggling to compensate with coping skills and even my medications when life gets stressful.I don’t get help from him around the house besides taking the trash out and he does not stop sending me into sensory overload at the end of a stressful day of work. 

I love him. There is so much to love which very much includes the hyperfixations, the wandering, interrupted conversations, and the way both of our impulsivities invite a lot of playfulness into our relationship. But, I know that playing caretaker when I myself also need support is not sustainable and will ultimately lead to burnout, even if I am medicated, in therapy, and actively practicing coping skills and accommodating myself. I want to be sensitive to his limits, but I sense that something else is at play here. 

How do I have a conversation around this? Is there something deeper going on?

difficulty dating while disabled ,"background: i'm 35 F disabled from a car accident with a severe brain injury and use a service dog. currently not working while i finish my workers comp case, but when i do find work again it will be very untraditional bc of my symptoms. 

i've honestly given up hope on meeting someone. i've been rejected from men i've met on dating apps when i talk with them and tell them with lines like ""i don't date disabled chicks"" etc. i also get met with the assumption im looking for something more than someone to share life with. i deleted all the dating apps bc i was so disheartened.

i haven't met anyone that's interested in dating someone that has needs. i have headaches, severe light and sound sensitivity, vestibular dysfunction (problems with balance and dizziness). some days are better than others and all the sudden i can have something trigger me, and im in bed for the rest of the day. but there are some days where i can do a decent amount. i've tried and interactions have left me so insecure ive stopped trying.

for example, i was dating a guy casually still getting to know each other and i invited him over for dinner. while preparing, i got a dizzy spell and had to lay down for a while til it passed. when he arrived, obviously i was behind and he made me feel so bad about not being ready at the time i gave. saying something like ""don't give a time if you can't be ready by then"" even though i was trying my best. this is just one example but there's been others.

the problem is , i am lonely and would like to meet a man that i could spend my life with. i dont want kids , never did but now i really dont, and thats another problem. it just feels like the odds are not in my favor.

any disabled people out there find success in dating? and how? currently, i feel too discouraged to get back on a dating app since i don't feel i have the same to offer as an abled person. have i just met assholes? i just don't know what to do.

Does anyone else feel guilt or shame about their sexual needs?,"I live in a country where sex work is legal and regulated but also attend a university in America. I started going to therapy when I came to America and have had several therapists try to convince me that having my sexual needs met from sex workers is the result of some unhealthy coping mechanism for some other underlying issue that they tell me that I’m responsible for figuring out as my therapy homework. I told every one of them the issue is probably just that I am human and that intimacy and sexual needs are normal. Every one of them told me I’m wrong and need to change my mindset if I want to get better. I don’t really understand if this is an American thing or a therapy thing. I should note that I haven’t tried to find any sex workers in America because I’m aware of the legality of it in America. I haven’t had this much shame about sex until I came to the America and started therapy around the same time. Also should note before anyone that goes after me that I don’t see sex workers in places known for human trafficking, prostituting minors, or other immoral things.

I saw someone else made a post recently about being rejected from a date because of their disability and read the comments so I at least feel a little less alone in knowing others have had those experiences as well. I’ve tried dating apps too. Didn’t go anywhere. No one outwardly rejected me for reason of my disability but sometimes I feel it too. After using dating apps I started getting a guilty feeling like as if I’ve been shortcutting intimacy and sexual needs when I’ve gone to sex workers. Like as if it’s something I need to have put hard work into and didn’t. I don’t know if this makes sense. The therapists have just told me in different ways to work on myself but I feel there’s only so much I can do that may not even help my feelings of lack of intimacy in America.",9,1ee0akr,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ee0akr/does_anyone_else_feel_guilt_or_shame_about_their/,12,1722145010.0

Get divorced to get full benefits?,"My husband and I have been on Medicaid for the past 4 years.

Could we get a divorce on paper so he could keep Medicaid? Would he be able to opt out of Medicare charges?

anyway, this will be my first time using these kinds of services and im very very very scared of basically people being awful to me, as i have read and heard of countless of horror stories from other disabled ppl using similar services.

My story.,"

Hello everyone. I am 24f and this is my story 

So i was born extremely premature at 24 weeks and had a brain hemorrhage at birth that affected my hearing and vision (i wear hearing aids).
I got glasses when i was around 6 years old, and growing up my eyes were bad enough that I was going to the eye dr every 6 months instead of every year. And each time i went, my prescription kept getting higher and higher.

Fast forward to me being 15-16 and trying to learn how to drive. I was completely terrified but i hated the fact that everyone else at school was getting their license and i wasn't. Also i was EXTREMELY stubborn and had the mindset of I will be just like everyone else and be as independent as possible. I did not want to acknowledge that i was disabled/different AT ALL. It took me 3 years to feel comfortable driving but i eventually got through it. My lifelong dream is to be a vet tech.

Skip a few years. I'm married, living away from parents and working at a pizza place. I really like my job. I gave up on my vet tech dream and am in community college for medical coding. But i start noticing something major. When i look through my right eye, i can't read words. Everything is blurry and shifted, like i'm trying to read underwater. I just brush it off as my vision getting worse like it usually does and try to ignore it.

 Honestly, i'm in survival mode. My marriage to an abusive man is failing (obviously) but again i'm too stubborn to give up on the marriage even in this situation. My mindset is well you always said one and only marriage now you have to deal with it. We are extremely poor. I'm smoking weed to cope with how shitty I feel my life is. I also get a ticket in April 2023 for ""following too close."" That will be relevant later.

November 2023. I finally have enough of the blurry vision in my right eye, it's getting extremely annoying to deal with. I call my dad and tell him the situation and he wants me to see my eye dr i had seen all my life because he trusts her. 2 hours away, where my parents live. He calls and makes the appointment. The soonest he can get is December 7, 2023, exactly a month away. I wait.

December 6 2023. My dad picks me up to take me to my mom's house (they're divorced). I tell my husband i'll see him tomorrow. Ha. Famous last words.

December 7 2023. My dad picks me up from my mom's and takes me to the eye appointment. We both are thinking that this will just be a normal prescription change, that we'll be in and out. Unbeknownst to me, the last few moments before my life forever changes. I tell the dr about the problems in my right eye. They put a letter on the screen. With my left eye I can tell it is a GIGANTIC A. But i still can't see it. Dr looks into my eye. She tells me to lean my chair back she'll be right back. This has never happened before. She comes back in with a magnifying glass the size of a baseball and me and my dad both realize something is definitely wrong.

She looks at my eye for literally 20 minutes, shining that bright light the whole time. Then she drops the bombshell. My retina is detached. She's calling a retina dr and seeing if he can get me in today. They keep asking me when the last time i had something to eat or drink was. I know that means surgery. I turn to my dad crying, saying i'm scared.

We go to the retina dr. It looks like a nursing home. I am the youngest patient there. We wait so long we think the dr has forgotten about us, then the nurse comes in. Says the dr is seeing everyone else first and me last because he knows he'll be with me a long time. Not a good sign. They keep asking me if i have been hit in the head recently. I lie and say no. (Husband).

The dr comes in. It's me, my mom, dad, and stepmom. He says that my retina has been detached for a very long time and is starting to die. That it's because of me being born premature, but no one ever told us this could happen. My mom is hysterical. I nicely ask her to calm down because I literally can't hear the dr speak over her. He says that the reattachment surgery will be very painful. And that i could possibly lose my actual eyeball. I need surgery right now, tonight. My dad walks out of the room and told me later that he completely broke down. I'm still sitting in the chair, completely terrified but smiling and saying that if i can get through being born, i can get through anything. Trying to keep everyone else calm.

We get to the hospital. I'm in the prep room. Everyone is there. Mom, stepdad, dad, stepmom. Everyone but the one person I want the most, the one I should be able to count on to be there no matter what. My husband. Deep down in my heart i know he's not coming. The dr says the surgery should be an hour and a half. My mom says later it was 3 hours. I get a scleral buckle and a gas bubble.

Fast forward a little. I finally tell my family about the abusive marriage. My dad asks how many times he slapped me in the face. I say probably 4 times in 5 years. He wonders if my husband is the reason for my eye problems.

Fast forward to now. I am divorced, and in a relationship with the sweetest most understanding gamer nerd in the world. I still have 2 semesters of college left, but i have also applied for disability. The retina dr says that i will never be able to read or drive with my right eye ever again. I have 2 cataract surgeries next month. I also have been diagnosed with macular degeneration and take eye vitamins every day. My bf and i have been talking about possibly moving in together down the road, and i have decided that if i get on disability, i want to be a foster mom for kittens. I have the best man and the greatest family. Life is good.",8,1edr2yo,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1edr2yo/my_story/,0,1722115563.0
Might finally be closer to an answer,"I’ve been searching for an answer of what’s wrong with me for a bit. I started having some symptoms around 2021 such as pain and muscle fatigue, but after being sent to rheumatology and them finding nothing the investigation kind of ended. Since then, and honestly mostly within the last year, my symptoms have significantly progressed to muscle spasms and cramps in my legs, falls and frequent stumbles/almost falls, tight muscles in my legs, urinary urgency, and the muscle fatigue and pain are still there but much worse. I can no longer walk independently and rely on forearm crutches (or a rollator at work) and I can’t walk for more than about 5-10mins without having to take a break and sit.  

I had a brain and cervical spine MRI in 2022 that came back normal except some mild degenerative signs in my cervical spine. And again, my symptoms have progressed a lot since then, but no recent doctor has wanted to redo my MRIs since my last ones were pretty recent. 

That was, until, the last neurologist I saw. I told her my symptoms and how they’ve progressed, and how quickly they’ve progressed in the last year (2023 I could pretty much walk without aids, and now, like I said, I can only walk 5-10minutes and I cannot walk without forearm crutches or rollator) and she ordered genetic testing for hereditary spastic paraplegia and a MRI of my brain and entire spine. 

I recently got these results back and the genetic test showed a VUS for autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia with an inconclusive ruling on if my specific variant is pathogenic, and my brain MRI showed a new finding of bilateral corticospinal tract hyperintensity at the level of the posterior limbs of the internal capsules. As far as I know, this basically means a part of my brain lit up on the MRI a bit more than it should have, and the area that lit up controls signals that are sent down my spine that are for movement function in my limbs. The results said this could be a possible sign of a motor neuron disease, such as spastic paraplegia. My back also showed various mild degenerative signs all along my spine at different points, but this wasn’t a surprise because back problems are very prevalent in my family. 

I just feel like I’m so close to maybe having an answer, but at the same time I’m so worried my doctor is going to say “no, none of this is clinically significant.” I have an appointment mid august to discuss my results and I’m just very nervous in all honesty. 

Camaraderie, support, advice, etc. is welcome by the way!

Edit: an appt opened up with my neuro for this Tuesday! I feel like the luckiest duck ever. ",3,1edvvsn,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1edvvsn/might_finally_be_closer_to_an_answer/,3,1722129628.0
Looking for Advice.,"Hello! My name is Zack. Today I ask one simple question, r/Disability.

A couple months back a good friend of mine suffered a spinal injury. They were laid up in the hospital for several weeks, released only recently and now in a wheelchair. They made the trip home safely and are supported by local family. That, at least, is good.

I got to thinking recently, while talking with a mutual friend about the matter. Are there things to look out for? In theory the wheelchair situation is temporary but we don't know how long temporary is. It could be weeks or months of physical therapy.

So I'm thinking. What are some accessibility concerns that may arise that most people don't think about? Is there something that will be useful navigating their home or life in general now? Money's not really an issue, but please refrain from suggestions that the money could instead buy a new car.",4,1edvhjg,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1edvhjg/looking_for_advice/,6,1722128347.0
Pain While Walking,"I (24,F) have Cerebral Palsy although I am able bodied and can walk. I have always realize that when I walk long distances and sometimes even shorter distances like a block or two. I get pain either after or while I walk and often it hurts to walk. I thought this was always normal to walk and experience pain but now being an adult I realize it’s probably not normal. I take Baclofen and do Physical therapy but still experience pain. I even take over the counter pain meds like back & muscle and sometimes that doesn’t help. 

I was wondering what I could do or if this is something I should bring up to my doctor or what options there possibly are to help with the pain and even if I should consider using a mobility aid.

Are we destined for a denial 8 months after an initial application for visual impairment. ,"I'm going to try to sum this up as briefly as possible because I'd really like to hear from other people about their thoughts on it. 

My fiance is 53. He worked as a police officer for 23 years, until November 2023 when he had a repeat NAION in his left (and only seeing eye) that left him legally blind. The only clear sight he has left is from a tiny triangle of vision in the top left corner of his left eye. He had the first NAION in June 2023 in his right eye, leaving him with no clear field of vision in that one at all. He also has a medhx of a heart attack and quadruple bypass surgery three years ago and surgery to replace one of the cervival discs in his neck secondary to injuries he sustained in a vehicle accident a year before that. He has grade four kellgren osteoarthritis in his hip that will be replaced in October and grade 3 kellgren osteoarthritis in both knees. Along with the ""normal"" heart disease diagnoses, like hypertension and high cholesterol, he also suffers from depression, anxiety, and PTSD, which he has been treating for years with medication and therapy.

We submitted his initial application for SSDI in November 2023. The medical review began on January 4, 2024, and that's where we've been stuck. Within the first weeks they had received all of his medical records, and had been sent back the 83759202 completed forms they sent for us to fill out by hand. At the end of January, they sent him to one of their orthopedic doctors to be evaluated, which we were confused about because we were under the assumption that his blindness alone would automatically qualify him. We had only included all his other medical diagnoses because it said we had to. For months we heard nothing, and then in April they sent him to be evaluated by their own ophthalmologist (despite his medical records indicating the same diagnoses from all three of the different ophthalmologists (including one of the best neuro ophthalmologists on the east coast) that he went to before he ever applied for disability when he still had hope that he had been misdiagnosed and his vision could somehow be restored. Since then... NOTHING. His case worked had originally been really helpful. She'd even answered her office phone the two times we called earlier in the process with questions, but for the past couple months we have been unable to reach her and she has not returned our calls. His application went from 73%-89% (a percentage or two every couple days) over the last two weeks, but has since changed to show the ""step 3 of 5"" statement when we log in.

I tried my best to decipher his actual central visual field acuity from the HVF 30-2 sita fast exams he was given, but was unable to figure it out and it's not specifically stated. The neuro-ophthalmologist who has been primarily treating his NAIONs diagnosis from the results of his most recent visual field test only stated he had a ""paracentral island in his only seeing eye."" His notes further state ""left optic neuropathy, NAION in both eyes, concentric visual field constriction of both eyes, presbyopia, and poor prognosis."" 

There is just no way I can understand how they could NOT determine he meets the requirements for statutory blindness, but reading so many others' experiences, and realizing that they are past even their own ""expected timeline"" for a decision according to his account when we log in. Does this seem like a bad sign that they're taking so long? Or that they're not considering his visual impairment as severe enough for statutory blindness somehow?

Should I try to make my cane more comfortable or should I just get a new cane?,"I bought a carex soft grip cane a while back to help with my hip pain when walking and I love the print on it and the fact that it's adjustable, but sometimes the handle kills my hand/fingers/shoulder.

Me (20M) and My Girlfriend (22F): Seeking Advice on Managing Severe Cognitive Issues and Financial Hardships While Navigating My First Job to Fund Medical Treatment,"

I really need some advice, and it's an emergency.

## Background

I'm a 20-year-old male student from a poor family. My single mother earns around ₹18,000 (about $215) a month. I have always been intelligent and sharp, knowing what I wanted to do with my life. Currently, I'm preparing for competitive exams and have no source of income. My mother's income barely gets us through the month, and it's a hard time for all of us.

## Mental Health Struggles

I have been dealing with depression since last year. Although I have recovered emotionally, my cognition and memory are at their worst. I can't remember what happened yesterday or even today. I can't recall a single name even if I read it five times. July has been the worst month, as I don't remember anything from it.

## Medical Challenges

My mother doesn't have enough money for a private or good doctor. The government doctor we saw doesn't acknowledge my problem and didn't provide me with suitable medicines. Making an appointment with them requires a two-day wait. My condition is worsening daily, so I had to turn to someone else—my girlfriend.

## Support from My Girlfriend

My girlfriend comes from a good financial background. She is the love of my life, and I want to do everything for her, but right now, my condition is so bad that sometimes I feel like I'll forget everything tomorrow and become brain-dead. In the past 2-3 months, I have seen many neurologists, psychiatrists, therapists, and dieticians. My mother paid for a few of them, but for the majority, my girlfriend paid for my sessions and medicines. I finally found a good psychiatrist who is helping me, though I'm still skeptical about whether I'll get better since my previous experiences with doctors were not good. I owe my girlfriend ₹12,284 (around $197). If my mother hears about this, she'd be very upset. I'm still seeing my psychiatrist and taking medicines, and I don't know when or if I'll get better. I can't keep asking my girlfriend for money, even though she says not to worry about it and to give her a small amount every month, which I am doing. But I feel the need to pay her back, so I decided to get a job to take matters into my own hands as I don't want to owe a very big amount that I wouldn't be able to pay her back.

## Job Struggles

I was nervous as this is my first job. Although I have worked in an NGO, this is my first salaried job. The salary is good for the job—₹13,000 (about $155). If I work there for 2-3 months, I'll be able to repay my girlfriend and have enough money for my treatment, hoping that I get better with that amount. However, I am still anxious about my brain and health. I went for the interview today, I forgot about the interview today when I woke up and it occurred to me 5-10 mins late that I had an interview today, and it was horrible. I got selected, though (it was mass recruitment, and everyone who came was hired). But I couldn't keep my head in one place, had multiple headaches, and zoned out multiple times. I couldn't comprehend what the recruiter was saying. I got so scared and anxious that I called my girlfriend and broke down in front of her. I just wanted to do the job to pay for my medical bills, but how can I do that if I forget what task I was assigned? I'll go there tomorrow and see how it goes. I told my mother about my job, she doesn't know why I'm doing that job and I don't want to burden her with the truth. She asked me not to do the job since it's very far and it's in a warehouse without any air conditioning and it's summer right now. 

## Desperation and Request for Help

"Perks of being disabled in USA? Like discounts, jobs, housing, etc.","**EDIT** - wow ok I get it. Perks isn’t the right word. We all are unfortunate to be disabled and it is the worse thing that can happen to us. However this thread is meant to help us disabled people get deals, discounts, opportunities etc. Calm down. The helpful comments have just gotten me free/reduced cost parks, museums, transit, etc. If you can get past your anger about my imperfect wording then a lot of these comments can potentially help you!

Those living in USA, what perks have you found for being disabled? Besides receiving a monthly disability check from the government have you gotten any other “deals”?

Where I live I got a gym membership, stand up comedy classes, cbd supplements, healthcare for either heavily discounted or free. I’m looking for other things that I should take advantage of because being disabled sucks and I want to make the most of it!

I’d love to maybe get a good job that is very friendly to disabled people and/or a job training program and/or higher education like a masters degree or some continuing education classes that usually cost a lot of money.

I’d also love to get my rent reduced with maybe a disability program or housing lottery.

And there are probably tons of other things out there that I don’t know about. Like I’ll stumble upon random things, sometimes it’ll say “financial assistance” at the bottom of some random website I’m looking at and then there will be a section for disabled people along with other things like low income and military veterans.

Sleeping in,I feel terrible asking this. I am 47 years old. I have obviously been an adult for several decades. I have had no problem with being on time up until the last 1.5 years. I am currently going through some very stressful things. I am bouncing back and forth between not being able to wake up and not being able to sleep (I have anxiety and depression). I have a strict job and must be signed in and signed out strictly at a certain time. I must call off within 15 minutes of start time. I have overslept 3-4 times in the last year. The second time I went on depression medications which I think helped. I had to go off of them 2 weeks ago because I developed bald spots and I really did not want to live with that. I have overslept again. I have purchased alarms. I have purchased an app subscription that sets off an alarm and requires a barcode be scanned to shut it off. I live alone. I do not know how I am shutting off these alarms but I did it again and woke up 7 minutes too late. I have an appointment scheduled with my doctor to discuss the meds. I do not know how to fix this with 100% success. And my work is requiring 100% success. Can I request ADA accommodations with the call off time until I figure it out? I am currently on an intermittent absence because I'm losing it a little with the other stressors and I may return on reduced leave (all unpaid).

My aunt accused me of faking my chronic illnesses/disabilities ,"Idk where to even start with this, it’s been a few days but I’m still just…idk if devastated is even the word? There’s so much nuance and little details I couldn’t begin to even add here. But I’ll try and condense it.

I’m employed for my family and need to work closely with my aunt, who has pretty severe trust issues but also major gossip issues. She doesn’t get along with anyone and is super quick to get mad if you say the wrong thing, or even if you didn’t say anything wrong in general and she interprets it that way. It feels like she’s always getting upset by something someone has done/said even if it’s not that bad; it feels like she’s always angry. I tried my hardest to be a support for her and her anxiety, and when working with her to try and be someone she could rely on. 
As time went on, the work is wearing on me badly. I’ve always been candid about my disabilities with her and we talked about chronic pain (what we both share) and I even spoke to her about my personal health issues and what it took to get diagnosed and she always seemed at least understanding. I tried my best not to call in but come in late on infusion days because calling in was next to impossible with how worried I was at making her mad at me. 

Anyways 

Fast forward to recently. Work has been excruciating. I’m autistic and have been chronically overwhelmed every single day, I was heavily su!cidal because of having to work in the amount of pain I was in, everything was too bright and too loud and too much all day all the time and I couldn’t even enjoy my 2 days off bc all I was doing was sleeping trying desperately to recover to do it all over again. I couldn’t use any mobility aids while at work bc it’s a hazard to what I have to do, I tried my hardest but genuinely feel as though my body was going to fall apart. A loved one of mine saw this and saw how desperate I was getting for reprieve and reached out to my aunt to try and talk to her about options, knowing she also had chronic pain. 
She took it completely the wrong way and blew up, like, exploded. Thinking my loved one was trying to “school” her on what chronic pain was, interpreting what they said as them saying I need to quit etc. she then goes to the group chat with me and a lot of her siblings to say she’s got those texts and is freaking out angry about them, then says: 

“I heard Giant doctor shops until they get the diagnosis they’re after”

(This broke my heart. I knew this comment came from my dad who has said this about me in the past when I was having to go to a lot of doctors to try and find out what was wrong with me and why I couldn’t really walk anymore suddenly)

And 
“I had honestly hoped they would blossom into this somehow and the illnesses would become less their focus” 

And 
“I was worried they would begin the “I am so sick, but I can get through it” behavior, but I also saw how they seemed to blossom” 

My dad has also used the “blossom” comment with me, which makes me hesitant that was her word choice. I know the reason people say that of me is because I’m medium support needs autistic and it’s hard for me to hold a job, so seeing me do one is “blossoming” I guess even though I’m literally falling apart at the seams so bad I’ll consider going ghost mode in the mornings just so I don’t have to go to work. 

The only person to even somewhat defend me was my other aunt, who did it in such a way that the aunt in question left the GC in frustration, so I’m grateful to my other aunt for that..I guess I’m just idk.

My stomach has been in knots ever since, I cried so hard that day I was hoarse and dehydrated I just don’t know what to do. I feel childish for avoiding talking to my father, but I know my aunt got those comments from him and even if years ago and even if he doesn’t think that way anymore (I think) he KNEW they came from him (I called him in tears asking if he had told her I doctor shop and he matter of factly said “yes…years ago” and then I hung up after I cried more) we haven’t spoken since that phone call. 
Am I dumb for wanting an apology? He wants to treat it like things are fine and back to normal but knowing he spoke about me that way and how it eventually came back to hurt ME and not him, and how he didn’t defend me and how he didn’t even try to correct the gossip…it makes me feel so…idk I guess betrayed. 

And as for my aunt, I feel dread if I have to see her again. I’m going to try and avoid her as best I can, she texted me a few days later trying to get information but I just screenshotted it and sent it to the GC and didn’t reply. I don’t think I want to speak to her ever again. This whole time. 
This WHOLE TIME. Like, I didn’t think she liked me, I knew she probably thought I was weird and annoying but oh my god I feel so stupid I ever shared personal information about myself or was vulnerable with her in any way. I was trying to support her, and be someone she could trust because she’s so hateful and angry and doesn’t trust anyone. She seemed to think we were a lot alike and she would vent to me often, say inappropriate weird things and I wouldn’t comment on it, I was always a passive person she could vent at and I tried so hard to be what I thought she needed. 
I shared how awful it was for me to try and be diagnosed and how many doctors I went to and how some things are still unresolved. This whole time she thought I was a fake. I just. I’m gonna cry just typing it. Some of it is stuff I couldn’t even fake if I tried, like a rare blood disease. 

I just don’t know what even compelled her to reply that way. My loved one was just like “hey I’m really concerned about giant’s health” and she flew off the handle to accuse me of something like that, in a group chat, to my extended family members. 

Sorry for the long vent I just, idk, I’m used to ableism but this just hurt so bad. The layers to it hurt. The fact that it was gossip, that it was what my dad said (even if a year ago, I guess that somehow stuck in her head), how she got to know me for months and didn’t even think to challenge that idea of me. 

I feel sort of lost. I don’t know what to do. It’s too late for me to reply, all I said was “I’ve never done that.” But she didn’t respond, ignored it and just continued talking to her sister. I thankfully have time off work now to try and recover but this whole thing makes me seriously wonder if I should even return. I need the money desperately, I don’t want to quit, but at the same time it’s destroying me. I wish someone had defended me more or I wish in the moment I had at least asked “why would you say that about me” something :(

Sorry I just needed to vent. It’s been a lot..

Looking for Advice,"Last year my father (61 Years old) fell and had a cut he left untreated. This turned into sepsis and put him into the hospital from December until May of this year. It was compounded by 3 years of not taking care of his diabetes and making his mobility poor at best. During this time, he started on short term disability from his office job, which then turned into long term disability as the months passed by. 

My dad lives on his own in Tennessee with no family or friends (outside of his work friends) and over 12-hour drive from my sister and I in Pennsylvania, and over 8 hours from his 5 brothers in various southern states like Georgia. He has large amounts of debt, rents a furnished home by the week, and owns no vehicle.

Upon release he was eager to get back to work even with his still limited walking capabilities. I had ordered him a walker to replace his less-than-ideal walker sent home from the hospital to assist with his mobility. He had also had a small fall leading to a cut on his forehead with the hospital walker. He then got in touch with the company he was employed with and began the process of trying to be able to work from home. They informed him they required him to report to the office instead and that he would need a return to work note from his doctor clearing him for work. 

This began the long process of trying to get him into a doctor for assessment and sign off. Once we were finally able to get him the documents his HR department requested. He was informed immediately that his disability checks were done. However, his HR then requested he provide additional doctors notes outlining his capabilities at work. Which led to more weeks of unpaid struggle to achieve. 

He finally had all the requested paperwork and was cleared to return to work. He was excited and ready to leave the house. During his first week back to work he was trying to carry his lunch from the break room back to his desk, but only having one hand on his walker led to him having a fall in the hallway. He hit his shoulder and head into the drywall but was okay (at least to his report to me). Another worker saw his fall in the office hallway and helped him back up and got him to the company nurse. She sent him home and was told to stay home while HR investigated. 

Yesterday his HR department informed him he was being put back on leave of absence and his position would be filled. They told him if he went back to the doctor to get a fitness of duty test outlining his need for a walker he could apply for other, lesser paying positions that I don't honestly believe even exist at the company.

So he is currently receiving no pay, no disability pay, and is desperate for help. Will likely be limited mobility for the remainder of his life. 

My wife and I rent, and our lease is very strict about having more than 2 people living in the house. My sister has a small home with 2 bedroom and young children. So we are hoping that we can find someplace extremely cheap for him to rent near us or that one of his brothers (not on the best of terms with each other) would take him in. 

I'm writing this in hopes that anyone with advice or insight into these types of disability situations could shed light on any options I may not be aware of. As his rental is weekly and he's now making no money its putting pressure on us to figure out options quickly.

Eyepatches to go under glasses?,"Hi I have a issue with my left eye and while it's not explicitly a disability I didn't know where else to ask this.

I am effectively blind in my left eye I only see enough for it to be an annoyance and look bad. It effectively extends my peripheral vision a further 80ish degrees left. I also have a insane drift in my left eye. So my left eye is constantly looking 45ish degrees further left. 

This drift is really disruptive. Whenever I'm at work on the computer, watching tv, gaming my left eye is constantly looking offscreen. When i go cinema I have to sit on the Far left or get a weird almost double image. Whenever travelling & I'm looking forward and my left eye is looking out the side window. Whenever I  walk & someone or something enters my left eyes fov I instantly turn my head because I can't tell what it was. 

The drift wasn't always that bad but it's been getting steadily worse across the years. & frankly it has been impacting my self-confidence. 

I can't afford the surgery to have the drift fixed & frankly i don't even know if the surgery is an option due to my epilepsy. So I thought about eye patches to block out the vision and it I hope it looks less bad. But most eye patches I've found suck for glasses users I was wondering if anyone found so good ones.

Walking a dog while disabled ,"Hi ! 
So I adopted a dog a few months ago after my childhood dog Tangka passed away. She's an elderly, 10 yo small dog that we named Gaia. Although she has an unknown past and is already pretty old, she's so energetic and happy and having her here is an absolute bliss. She's so cute and an absolute sweetheart. 

But there is a problem, walking her is so painful, and I have trouble going outside at all. I have really debilitating migraines, chronic pain and sensory issues, so being outside for a walk can be an absolute nightmare. Walking for a long time can worsen my headaches, and like most dogs she also likes to bark a lot, which adds to it and can induce sensory overload. 

I live with my mother who can also walk her, but she also has some troubles doing so.
I really wand Gaia to have the best life possible, but being a pet owner just in general can be so difficult. I haven't got much time to get to know my disabilities since I was diagnosed recently, so I'd really appreciate it if you could give me some advice.

Am I Being Dramatic About A Situation?,"I have a hair stylist and she is abled bodied. Her business is a private business and she says she doesn’t have to follow the ADA (which she totally DOES have to follow the ADA).

I ask them to move. I slowly roll towards them. I nudge them with my feet. I repeat. But they keep sitting or laying in the way.

I completely understand that these devices need to be medical grade, but I often find these very bulky looking. My family member is totally new to this, and has been having trouble to accept using mobility aids for that very reason. 

Does anyone know anywhere that sells good-looking ones? 

Edit: we’re quite new to this, and not even sure what mobility aids will be required. At the moment we’re looking at hand rails for the house, bathroom rails and a rail for the toilet, and things like a shower seat. We also may need to look at zimmer frames. 

My question is: where do you go to look for these things? Ideally ones that are a little more subtle looking/aesthetic and less medical looking (again, not 100% sure what I’m looking for!)

What actually happens when you file a complaint against a home health care agency?,"What exactly does APD do when you file the complaint against the agency? Does it actually have any kind of meaningful repercussion or impact that prevents the company or company owners or whoever from continuing to mistreat clients?

Or is it essentially just a useless blemish on their record? 

I had to file a complaint against the owner of the agency that provides my In-Home Care because she was being extremely verbally abusive. Was threatening me. Was just talking about me in a way that's very vulgar. 

But now my caregiver is like...offended that I reported the agency even though I did my best to keep the caregiver's name out of it and to make sure to talk very highly of the caregiver whenever her name was brought up. 

I don't trust either of them now. Especially since the caregiver is now trying to gaslight me to protect herself. Trying to claim like the company owner never threatened me, when I know for a fact that she did. The caregiver's trying to play dumb about the threats now. But that's whatever. If that's what she wants to do, I can't stop her. 

What's really bothering me is that she tried to gaslight me into believing that I was lying to APD about the threats that the company owner was making against me.",4,1ecesza,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ecesza/what_actually_happens_when_you_file_a_complaint/,2,1721966512.0
How can I take care of myself and my child?,"I'm currently disabled from fibromyalgia and long covid.  My doctor recommends that I get lots of rest, don't over exert myself, and do my best to use what energy and ability I have to live healthy.  My husband says he understands, but he says his work prevents him from doing anything around the house, much less take care of our young child.

So I've been pushing through.  Sacrificing my wellbeing to keep our household afloat.  I knew he was playing computer games when he said he was working overtime, but I just count it towards his work as a destress portion.

It's come to my attention that he is playing computer games almost everyday, and he's not only been playing in the evening and weekends, he's been playing during work hours.

In the last two weeks he's clocked in over 85 hours of game time.  Today he's not even hiding it anymore.  I can hear him talking on discord while playing during the day.

My health is failing because I'm not getting the rest and care I need.  Our child is being neglected by him.  The little interaction they have with each other tend to be negative. I could speak up about it, but from past experience I know he will just get furious, deny he did anything wrong, and then turn it around on me when I point out the evidence and he can't deny it anymore.  I didn't even say anything and he got mad at me when I accidently walked in on him playing computer games when he should have been working.

I've been living like a single mother with a disability.  We both have income, but sometimes I wonder if it's any different than being on my own income only since he is controlling and spending it secretly on the side.  The difference is my income is from disability benefits and that's as stable as my condition, not very stable.

I guess I'd like to ask people who have a disability, how are you managing your wellbeing if you have no help and also have a young child.  Are there any affordable services that can help?  Do you have techniques or ideas on how to survive the situation?",14,1ec5j7e,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ec5j7e/how_can_i_take_care_of_myself_and_my_child/,5,1721940365.0
How can I stop being resentful towards my mother for her disability?,"My mom has a chronic pain condition from a spinal cord injury. She can walk and stand for a short period of time. She doesn’t leave the house except to get groceries because of her pain. 
My father passed away, (they weren’t together) and he was the only person who could get me out of the house. My mom said I couldn’t go to driver’s ed until I didn’t have any D’s or lower on my report card. I was able to get my grades up and pay for it, (and got a car) but I can’t get my license if I’m only driving once every two weeks. 
I feel so trapped. She is constantly complaining even driving me to work. I don’t have any connections anymore. I don’t have a nice family, and have been too depressed to care to make/keep up with friends. I want to experience life. I want to go places and do things and not be in my head all day. I want to be normal. My social skills have declined so bad since COVID (she’s immunocompromised and was extremely paranoid and obsessive about it for years, even after my whole family got vaccinated and after the cases dropped to nearly none) I don’t feel like I have the tools to be successful because I have been so sheltered. Not leaving the house has made my depression worse, especially over the summer. There is public transportation in my town, but it would take me hours to even get to a bus stop. I feel so bad for feeling resentful and so bad that I don’t even feel a connection towards my mother in the first place. I don’t feel resentful for us living in poverty for so long because she can’t work, I don’t feel resentful that I have to help her or listen to her complaints or that she doesn’t care to do the things she is capable of doing either. I don’t know why this is the thing I’m resentful of. 

Edit: I just wanted some help. I didn’t want to have to justify a single comment I made, knowing damn well how she spent all of our money on canned goods, talked about it every single day, and kept me home for years even though we were all vaccinated, instilled crippling fear into me and my brother, and wore masks and she made me wear masks long after everyone had stopped. It’s not like I don’t believe in COVID, or don’t know how it works, don’t know it’s not over, or even don’t understand how life-threatening it is for immunocompromised people. Her fear was warranted, but it was an unhealthy obsession based on the amount of her life is dedicated to it vs. her chances of getting it. I was scared of being the “bad guy,” so I tried explaining these things, but some of you I cannot reason with. You’re missing the point entirely. I need help on one issue, but you are latching on to one comment I made and becoming offended. I have nowhere else to post this to find people with experience in disability. I value your input, but you are not understanding the gravity of her obsession.",0,1ed4hlp,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ed4hlp/how_can_i_stop_being_resentful_towards_my_mother/,42,1722043385.0
My mom does not understand im disabled,"I have been asking my mom for mobility aids and she says no bc my doctor has not explicitly stated to get them. He also said i need to be sweating everyday NOT EVEN WALKING JUST SWEATING and she points to that as him saying i dont need them.

She asked about them today and he said to focus on electrolytes and medicine YES THATS GOOD BUT ALSO I CANT MOVE. I can barely walk with migraines and walking to long is a trigger. Not even walking. Walking for too long. She tells me i have to improve my cardiovascular health yeah that will help me but it will not completely mitigate my fatigue and pain. I AM DISABLED NOT LAZY.

She keeps telling me to workout and what my plan is to improve my cardiovascular health mom i have MIGRAINES.

Sorry this is a very long winded rant. Uhhh of you have advice how to help explain this to her much appreciated 

Edit: hi i wrote this very frustrated and not expecting very many repsonses lol, let me explain some context

1. My mom for a long time didnt want to acknowledge my disability. Ive been grappilng with this for around 3 years meow and i have started calling it a disability and saying im disabled. She didnt like this at first and felt like it was too extreme of a label. 
Once when we were taking a walk i was explaining i cant do it with a migraine and i probably shouldnt have been doing it that day either (postdrome from a 3 day migraine) and she said “well are you disabled in the legs?” I immediately got a rebound migraine.

2. Yes, i do have a neurologist and i do take both preventative daily meds and i have sumatriptan and one for nausea. Seemed to be a very common comment lol

3. My mom has started a new diet and is constantly pointing out whats health, whether something has fiber, if a meal is balanced, that i should have protein, etc. she also started to tell me i needed to work out more because i should improve my cardiovascular health. All of this isnt wrong but shes started to equate this to relieving my migraines. Also, when i had a consistent sleep schedule (aka sleeping very early bc im an early bird) she told me i had to push it back but when i asked why she couldnt give me a reason. 

Thank you all for your advice in comments and sorry if this is all still messy",31,1ebwb2e,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ebwb2e/my_mom_does_not_understand_im_disabled/,43,1721917777.0

Finding an Accessible Home Post-Breakup – Need Tips and Solace,"Hey everyone,

I recently went through a breakup after several years with my partner, and it’s thrown my life a bit out of balance. We used to split household chores, like laundry and yard work. The laundry room is in the basement, so my partner always took care of that. They’re moving out soon, and while I can manage laundry a few times on my own, it’s not a sustainable solution for me.

When we moved in together, my physical disability was not as advanced. I had a lot more balance and strength in my lower limbs, but now I don’t, which makes it difficult to go downstairs to do laundry. I’m struggling with the confusion and sadness from the breakup, and on top of that, having to think about living accommodations that I’m not quite ready for feels overwhelming.

In my area, everything is expensive, but you get more bang for your buck if you buy a house. You get more space, anyway. Buying a condominium unit would mean that I have the exterior taken care of, so I wouldn’t need to worry about that. I know there are some condominium houses that take care of the outsides, but I’m not sure if I need the extra space of a house when living alone. Maybe I’m just scared of moving on and really getting a fully accessible place.

I don’t think I’m scared of my disability anymore—I’ve been dealing with it for a long time—but I guess I’m hesitant because moving into a more accessible place would just make my life easier. At the same time, I want to keep trying to move around and use a walker as long as I can before switching to a wheelchair full time, which I will do when I need to.

I’m considering selling our house and buying a new place. Ideally, I’d prefer not to move into an apartment or condo, but I think it might be the best option for the long term. I’m having trouble finding accessible options in my area. Most listings only mention an accessible entryway, but I need more than that.

I’m also looking for a realtor who understands accessibility needs, but I haven’t found any specialists yet. Does anyone have tips on finding accessible housing or a knowledgeable realtor? Any advice or solace would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, everyone.",4,1ecbysk,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ecbysk/finding_an_accessible_home_postbreakup_need_tips/,2,1721957630.0
How to manage having a  disability after parents death. ,"My Mom basically manages a lot for me. 
She’s my payee representative, she files my taxes on my behalf, she makes sure my rent gets paid. I can barely fill out things such as medical paperwork and applications without having to call my mom and ask her questions without me getting too overwhelmed and then shutting down. She keeps defensively saying: Well what are you going to do once I die?!Sometimes I wish I could just vanish and disappear. I’m tired of feeling like a burden and I wish no one would have to help me with anything. I don’t think its realistic for me to be able to manage this all by myself one day because of my disability but are there any organizations I can reach out to who would help me manage my life closely and help me take care of all this type of stuff? At this point I just want to get out of her hair and avoid her as much as possible. I’m pretty sure she loves me but she didn’t expect to have to help her disabled adult daughter for the rest of her life so she’s experiencing caregiver burnout 🔥What kind of organizations can I try to look into?

Just wondering about help I could get for school,"I’m bad at these types of things but mostly just looking for advice, I am both physically and mentally disabled, on the mental side its ASD, ADHD, getting tested for I think its called something like disorder of written expression very soon, getting tested for narcolepsy soon, and various other things, and on the Physical side its some junk with one of my lower legs plus foot (bone weird after break, in a brace currently with more junk upcoming), Fibromyalgia, plus maybe other things they are being annoying about testing about (fibro doesnt fit the whole bill, all you gotta know is very bad regular pain, brain fog, stomach issues, migraines, extreme fatigue, all that junk)
 Well so I’m about to go into my “final” year of high school and I know from especially last year (when I got my first major punch in the face from fibro) that I won’t physically be able to complete all my course work in time, the reason I say final like how I did is because I have accepted since last year that unless jesus himself were to walk down and do something I am not graduating in time, so that brings me to what I want to do, make the most of it.

I am already not gonna pass on time so why dont I make the most of that crap and do half the junk this year and the rest next year, it would 
1. allow me to reduce the strain on myself (my body has very strict limits that even just something as simple as writing for 5 minutes or typing for 40 surpasses, ive tried my best to increase them but with little progress so far) 
and 2. be able to let me get actual good grades in the classes I will have, i barely squeeked by in the ones I didnt realize i had to give up last year and this would give me more a chance to focus.

I have even discussed this with both parents and some doctors (main ones I need to get to are the pain doctors) and they all agree this would be best but the issue is, we know that no matter what we do the school is gonna be stubborn about it, do any of you have any advice to help make it happen? My therapist has straight up told me to go over which classes to take this year with her once i get my schedule and once we decide to just flat out ignore the rest while we are getting it sorted, this is happening weather the school wants it or not, but still some advice on how to get any actual support from the school would be nice.

sorry for ramblinging and if its hard to read just tell me ways to help that and ill try to fix it, just looking for advice",0,1echq8g,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1echq8g/just_wondering_about_help_i_could_get_for_school/,4,1721977332.0

 I’m late to the James Somerton train but his view on AIDS makes me mad.,"


I'm late to the James Somerton train but his view on AIDS makes me mad.

For context for those of you here which are not terminally online. James Somerton was a popular gay YouTuber whose popularity dropped like a rock when fellow YouTuber HBomberguy made a video on plagiarism exposing him and other YouTubers.

Somerton has been through a lot of shit and I don't want to add more onto it but his videos on AIDs made me mad. I relate to his plagiarism reasons even if I don't approve.



his base assumption was that all the radical gays died of AIDS leaving the ""boring ones"".



it ignores how AIDS was transmitted yes through sex and needles but also through tainted blood transfusions. which killed and infected thousands of people with Hemophilia and other conditions that require blood transfusion regardless of political views, sexuality, and gender.



Ryan White was a icon of AIDs victims because he was an all-American suburban boy who got AIDs from a blood transfusion.



it also suggests that radicalism is tied to someone's sexual behavior. when many radical leftists did not have sex or did drugs for whatever reason.

giving his other acts of acephobia it seems to be a common trend with Somerton who thinks abstaining from sex makes you a square.

Which is funny as he is one of the so called “boring gays”.

There is a grain of truth in that poorer people tend to have more radical politics and thanks to lack of resources they tend to die more. But it’s not a AIDS thing.

In general while the AIDS epidemic impact on the queer community is discussed the impact it had on the disabled community among people who required regular blood transfusions like Hemophilics is ignored expect for certain cases like Ryan White.",21,1ebrn7t,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ebrn7t/im_late_to_the_james_somerton_train_but_his_view/,2,1721903815.0
Did you ever get gig that showed how really weak you are?,"I know we all have different experiences, but I wanted to ask if you've ever gotten a really good gig, or job, but were later forced to quit because you realized you weren't up to it. 

As a paraplegic with limited education from a third-world country, online gigs are usually all I have to make a living. Apart from my blog, which isn't as successful as it was at the start, I recently landed a good-paying gig as a chat agent for a company. I was successfully accepted into the role. 

I thought this was it – I'd finally found a job I could really do and actually stop worrying about not being able to pay for everything that's important to me. But that wasn't really the case after four days of working. The job had eight-hour shifts plus a 30-minute lunch break, and I was always exhausted after each shift, feeling unusual pain all over my body. After four days of working, I finally quit because my body really couldn't take it. This has really depressed me as it showed how much weaker I am than I thought.

And the pain of giving up this opportunity came immediately after I received payment for the four days I had worked. It was $38 (which is great money in my country), as it helped me pay for my internet for at least two more months and some groceries. That makes it even more frustrating for losing the opportunity. It was more than I had earned in ad revenue for my blog in three months. I felt really angry that I lost such a great opportunity that was going to change my life, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. 

Thanks for reading my rant, and I wanted to ask if anyone has ever faced something similar?",5,1ec3bgk,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ec3bgk/did_you_ever_get_gig_that_showed_how_really_weak/,1,1721934961.0
